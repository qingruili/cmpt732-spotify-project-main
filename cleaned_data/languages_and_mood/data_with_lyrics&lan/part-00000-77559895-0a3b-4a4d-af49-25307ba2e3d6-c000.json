Within seventy-two hours, 3,000 U.S. boats were headed for Cuba. In the next few weeks, it became evident that Castro was forcing the boat owners to carry back with them not only their relatives but the dregs of his jail population. By the time the port was closed 125,000 'Marielitos' had landed in Florida. An estimated 25,000 had criminal records. This is the story of that minority -- those they call 'Los Bandidos.'\n\nThe prologue is shredded diagonally by the blade of a\nstiletto and in the empty black void we:\n\nCUT TO\n\nOpening Montage - Documentary Footage:\n2 THE DISEMBARKATION\nfrom the harbor in Mariel, Cuba. Vessels of every nature,\nwaving masses, demonstrations....\n\n3 THE CROSSING\nSun and storm.\n\n4 THE LANDING - KEY WEST\nThe flag of the United States. Choppers swooping over the ragged coastline of the Keys. Emerald waters dotted with fishing trawlers and pleasure craft, an \"America the Beautiful\"-type Immigration theme surging over this.\n5 THE PROCESSING\nLong lines. Immigration and Nationalization Officials, customs, Public Health, FBI, Church and Relief Organizations.\nBabies bawling, arguments over paperwork, refugees being\ninterviewed by TV news, people crying, people eating,\nfamilies huddled on floors... chaos.\nThe music theme continuing in stately calm as we:\n\nCUT TO\n6 INT. OFFICE - PROCESSING HALL - AFTERNOON -\nA FULL and CLOSEUP OF\n\n7 TONY MONTANA 7\nthe scar-faced one, in the young angry prime of his life.\nWe dwell first on the scar which he likes to scratch now and\nthen. We move to the eyes, pure in their fury. Finally we\nencompass the face -- the face of a man about to explode --\nmuscle, tissue, brain -- a man willing to live or die and\non the increment of a moment, inflict or receive either one.\nHe is clothed in rags crossed with holes, his shoes broken\ncardboard, his hair unkempt, his complexion sallow from\nprison.\n\nOver this:\n\nVOICE #1 (o.s.)\nOkay so what do you call yourself?\nVOICE #2 (o.s.)\nComo se llama?\n\nMONTANA\nTony Montana...you?\n\nVOICE #1\nWhere'd you learn to speak the English, Tony?\n\nMONTANA\nMy old man -- he was American. Sailor. Bum.\nI always know, y'know, one day I gonna come to America.\nI see all the movies...\n\nVOICE #1\nSo where's your old man now?\n\nMONTANA\nHe's dead. He died. Somewhere...\n\nVOICE #1\nMother?\n\nTONY\nShe's dead too.\nVOICE #2\nWhat kind of work you do in Cuba, Tony?\n\nTONY\nThis. That. The Army. Some construction work....\n\nVOICE #2\nUnhunh. Got any family in the States, Tony? Cousins, brother-in-law?\n\nTONY\n(a beat)\nNobody. Everybody's dead.\n\nMAN #I\nY'ever been in jail, Tony?\n\nTONY\nMe jail? No way.\n\nWe now reveal three men in civilian clothing in the dark afternoon light of the little room. Actually it's a plywood office somewhere in the processing hall and we hear the din from the hall over the question and answer. Two of the men sit around a desk, the Third Man stands in a corner, staring at Tony, the most authoritative-looking of the three.\n\nMAN #l\n(checking off a list)\nYou been in a mental hospital, Tony?\n\nTONY\n(grinning)\nYeah, in the boat coming over.\n\nMAN #1\nHow 'bout homosexuality, Tony? You like men, y'like to dress up like a woman?\n\nTONY\n(to Man #2)\nNever tried it. What the fuck's wrong with this guy, what's he think I am?\n\nMAN #2\nJust answer the questions, Tony.\n\nThe voices of the men remain cool and collected throughout.\n\nTONY\n(to Man #1)\nFuck no.\n\nMAN #1\nArrested? Vagrancy? Marijuana?\n\nTONY\nNO. ...NO. Never. Nothing.\n\nHis eye movements are rapid (over shoulders, sides, doors)\nand he does a lot of touching -- objects -- lightly with the\ntips of the fingers. Man #3 is stepping forward out of the\nshadows.\n\nMAN #3\nSo where'd you get the beauty scar?\n\nTONY\nThis?..\n(scratching the scar, shrugs)\nI was a kid. You should see the other kid.\n(a grim chuckle)\n\nMAN #3\nAnd this?\n\nHe holds up Tony's hand and indicates the tattoo between the\nthumb and second finger -- a heart with the word \"Madre\"\nscaled through it.\n\nTONY\nOh that was for my sweetheart.\n\nMAN #3\nSweetheart?\n(to the other men)\nWe been seeing more and more of these. It's some kinda code these guys used in the can. Pitchfork means an assassin\nor something. This one's new... You want to tell us, Montana or you want to take a little trip to the detention center?\n\nTONY\nHey, so I was in the can once for buying dollars. Big deal.\n\nMAN #3\nThat's pretty funny, Tony.\n\nTONY\nSome Canadian tourist....\n\nMAN #3\nWhat'd you mug him first? Get him outta here!\n(starts to walk out)\n\nTONY\nHey, so I fuck Castro, what's it to you? You a Communist or something?\nHow would you like it they tell you all the time what to think, what to do, you wanna be like a sheep, like everybody else. Baa baa? Puta! You want a stoolie on every block? You wanna work eight hours a day and you never own nothing? I ate octopus three times a day, fucking octopus is coming out my ears, fuckin' Russian shoes are eating through my feet. Whaddaya want? You want me to stay there? Hey, I'm no little whore, I'm no stinking thief! I'm Tony Montana and I'm a political prisoner here from Cuba and I want my fucking 'Human Rights' just like President Jimmy Carter says, okay?\n\nSilence.\nThere's a certain eloquence to the man`s plea but\nit falls on disbelieving ears. One of them chuckles.\n\nMAN #l\nCarter should see this human right. He's good. He's very good. What do you say Harry?\n\nMAN #3\n(walking out)\nI... 'Freedomtown.' Let them take a look at him. A long look.\n\nTONY\nHey, that's okay, too, Harry. No hard feelings.\n\nMan #3 at the door stops, looks back.\n\nTONY\nSend me here, send me there. This.\nThat. Nothing you can do to me\nHarry, Castro didn't do -- nothing....\n\nThat taunting smile on Tony's lips as, to the music of the\nimmigration theme, we:\n\nDISSOLVE TO\n7-A INT. FEDERAL BUS - HOUR LATER 7-A\nThe bus is packed with the harder-looking refugee-types.\nThe windows are caged and we see INS guards.\nThe noise level is high, like a sack of monkeys.\n\nManny (Manolo) Ribera's got his feet up on an empty seat.\nHe's big, strong, handsome, with dashing darkly feminine\neyes -- younger than Tony, and dapper in his cheap clothing.\nHe's eating a Baby Ruth candy bar.\n\nMANNY\nSeat's taken.\n\nTONY\nSo I'll sit in your lap.\n\nTony pushes his feet off, sits. He takes the Baby Ruth out\nof Manny's hand, peels out the bar of chocolate, then\nreturns the empty wrapper to Manny,\n\nTONY\nSo what'd you tell them?\n\nMANNY\nI told them what you told me to tell them. I told them I was in sanitation in Cuba.\n\nTONY\nI didn't tell you sanitation. I told you to tell them you was in a sanitarium, not sanitation.\n\nThe bus pulling out now.\n\nMANNY\nIs that what you told me? You didn't tell me that.\n\nTONY\nYou know if you hadn't opened your mouth, they woulda thought you were a horse. I told you to tell them you had TB and was cured.\n\nMANNY\nFuck you Tony....\n\nTONY\nYou did nothing right. I shoulda left you in Cuba.\n\n7-B EXT. MIAMI FROM BUS - ESTABLISHING SHOT 7-B\nof Miami as, to the music of the Immigration theme, we:\n\nDISSOLVE TO\n8 INT. TONY'S TENT - FREEDOMTOWN - NIGHT (SIX MONTHS LATER) 8\n\nA movie projector...\n...the face of Bogart -- unshaven, paranoid. We're watching a badly damaged 16 mm print of The Treasure of the Sierra-Madre. It's near the end of the film and he's alone, talking to himself just before the bandits get him....\n\nThe rag-tag audience is noisily yammering back at the screen,\nthe camera moving past Manny Ray, chewing gum, hair slicked,\neyes in cat-like repose... to Tony, enrapt, eyes like an eleven year old, mouth hanging open.\n\nBOGART\nWhat a thing.\nConscience. Conscience.\nIf you believe you've got a conscience, it`ll pester you to death. But if you don't believe you've got one, what can it do to you? Makes me sick so much talking and fussing about nonsense.\nTime to go to sleep.\n(closes his eyes\nbut not for long)\n\nCUT TO\n\n9 INT. TENT - LATER THAT NIGHT 9\nTony is moving down 23rd Street, the walk proud and jungle\nin the rock of the hips and the cast of the shoulders --\nnow accompanied by his handsome compadre, Manny.\n\nTONY\nThat Bogart, Chico, hunh?\n\nMANNY\nFucking crazy, hunh!\n\nTONY\nThat gold dust blowing in the wind.\nY'see Manny, he's always looking over his shoulder. Hunh? Like me....\n\nHe hunches, darting exaggerated looks over his shoulder,\nimitating Bogart. Manny laughs. In his black shirt with\nzig-zag dots and colors and the baggy pants and sunglasses,\nTony's starting to look American. He's even got himself a\npop button pinned to his shirt that says \"Fuck Off and Die.\"\nAnd his English rolls faster off his tongue, his confidence\nmore pronounced.\n\nTONY\n. . . don't trust nobody.\n\nMANNY\nYeah all that gold, hunh -- I guess you get so crazy you never trust nobody no more.\n\nTONY\nNever happen to me, Chico. That's one thing I never gonna be. I never gonna be crazy like that.\n\nMANNY\nYeah, how do you know....\n\nTONY\nI know.\n\nMANNY\nI don't know. Sometimes you crazy, too, Tony.\n\nTONY\nAssholes, I go crazy. You Manny, I never go crazy with you. You're\nlike my brother, I love you!\n\nMANNY\nYeah, sure.\n\nTONY\nHey, c'mon.\n\nTony playfully punches Manny and they walk on into the humid night, intersecting a young punk, Chi-Chi.\n\nCHI-CHI\n(to Manny; Spanish)\nHey Manny.\n\nMANNY\nOye Chi-Chi, what's going down.\n\nCHI-CHI\nUsual shit. Want some peanuts? Pago's carrying tonight.\n\nMANNY\nI don't know, I get all fucked up on it....\n\nCHI-CHI\nWant some new snatch? A pussycat\nname of Yolanda just rolled onto the\nBoulevard ---\n\nMANNY\nOh yeah, what she look like?\n\nCHI-CHI\nShe look like you 'cept she got a snatch.\n\nMANNY\nA real snatch?\n\nCHI-CHI\nYou're not kidding. It talks.\n\nAs they chatter, Tony moves on with a movement of the head\nfor Manny. \"Later.\"\n\nHe's in the middle of the \"Boulevard\" where a bustling black\nmarket in toiletries, clothing, cigarettes, and transvestites is conducted nightly in the harsh glare of barrack neon.\n\nHe ambles past a bunch of young guys throwing a Frisbee,\npast a \"Viva Carter!\" proclamation in graffiti....\n\nTRANSVESTITE\n(passing)\nWhat about you sugar -- you wanna party?\n\nTONY\n(passing her)\nYeah with whose cock, honey?\n\nCUT TO\n\n10 EXT. FREEDOMTOWN GROUNDS - NIGHT 10\nTony, five minutes later, in a phone booth, in the middle of a bank of them, dozens of Marielietos pressing to get in, trying still to contact somebody -- anybody -- on the outside.\n\nTony is dialing, his eyes shifting down to the telephone\nnumber written in pencil on the back of a snapshot- As he\nfinishes the number, he flips the snapshot over and we see\na young girl, about thirteen years old, dark, tiny, fiery,\nstanding together with a dog and Tony, early twenties, in\nshadow, the fringes of the photo heavily tattered with\nhandling. Tony stares at it, his mind drifting as the phone\nrings in a distant place. A brief moment of repose we have\nnot yet seen in Tony.\n\nSomeone picks up the phone. An older woman's Voice. His\nexpression alters to uncertainty.\n\nVOICE\nYes? ...Hello? ...Who is this?\n\nTony changes his mind, hangs up. Pause. The faces of those\nin line peer in, the next party raps on the door, but Tony\nignores it, slips the snapshot back into the wallet in his\npants, then at his own pace, exits the phone booth.\n\nHe walks a few beats, his eyes pensive. Then recognizes\nsomebody in another phone booth and goes over.\n\nAngel Fernandez has got the face of one, as he argues on\nthe phone, then hangs up, a desolate look on his face, a\nworn phone book in his hand.\n\nTONY\nAngel, how ya doin'?\n\nANGEL\nYou know how many goddamn Fernandezes are living in fucking Union City? And I gotta call every fucking one of 'em to find my brother!\n\nTONY\n(in passing)\nDon't waste your dime, Chico. You know your brother hates you.\n\nANGEL\nGo fuck yourself, Tony.\n\nManny catches up to Tony.\n\nTONY\nWhatcha hanging around with that hustler for?\n\nMANNY\nHey Chi-Chi's okay, he hears things,\n\nTONY\nWhat's he hear I don't hear.\n\nAngel comes over, listens.\n\nMANNY\nHe hears we got problems. Immigration is having these hearings, y ' know? And they're saying nine out of ten of us is gonna get shipped back!\n\nTONY\nOh yeah?\n\nMANNY\nYeah. And a lotta shit just went down at Indiantown Gap. In Pennsylvania. Riots, fires, broken heads... things are gonna pop here.\n\nTONY\nShit, I coulda told you that.\n\nMANNY\nYeah, so what do you think the immigration's gonna do when we riot? You think they're gonna let us out? They're gonna throw away the key, that's what.\n\nANGEL\nOh shit!\n\nMANNY\nWhat's I say. This is gonna end bad, muchachos....\n\nTONY\nHey, I tell you guys this isn't Cuba here, this is the United States. They got nothing but lawyers here. We're on the television. We're in the newspapers. Whatta they gonna do -- ship us back to Cuba? Castro-- he don't want us. Nobody no place wants us so whatta they gonna do -- put us in a gas chamber so all the people can see? They're stuck with us, Chico -- they gotta let us go!\n\nMANNY\nYeah, well, what if we gotta sit here another six months, hunh?\n\nTONY\nYou worry too much, mi hermano. Like the man says, 'when you got 'em by the balls, their hearts and minds gonna follow' --hunh?\n\nTony winks and walks off.\n\nThe radio is playing hard rock, something like Blondie or Benatar from the stoop of a nearby barrack. Tony loves the sound and swings into it, snapping his fingers and rolling his hips like Presley. He back-peddles, smiling at Manny and Angel.\n\nTONY\n(in awful imitation)\n'Oh yeah America! Love-to love you baby, oh yeah!'\n\nCUT TO\n\n11 EXT. PLAYING FIELD - DAY - TWO WEEKS LATER\n\n\nCamera on Tony shuffling and feinting a soccer ball in an impromptu game; he's covered with sweat, tires a fancy move\naround a younger kid who not only steals the ball away off him but manages to lay him flat on his face.\n\nTONY\n(lying there)\nAw fuck....\n\nThe game, leaving him behind, shifts downfield.\n\nMANNY\nAye ! Tony! C'mon!\n\nManny, just arrived at the edge of the field, waves him off.\nTony, getting up, brushing himself off, walks off the field\ntowards him.\n\nANGEL\n(at a distance)\nHey Tony where ya going?\n\nTONY\nI got better things to do.\n\nANGEL\nChicken liver, hunh?\n\nTONY\n(to Manny)\nYeah?\n\n(looking zd)\nLet's walk.\n\nThey walk.\n\nMANNY\nYou ready for the good news, cone?\n\nTONY\nYeah.\n\nMANNY\nWe can be outta here in thirty days.\nNot only that.

Loudspeakers\nblast. Injured refugees lie bleeding on the grounds.\n\n24 AN ENTIRE BARRACK\nnow goes up in flames.\n\n25 INSIDE THE BARRACK\nA bewildered Emilio Rebenga grabs his papers and valuables.\n\nManny runs up on him.\n\nRebenga sees him, senses danger, flees down the aisle with his satchel, intersecting other panicked refugees.\n\nManny follows.\nRebenga stumbles into a bed frame, shatters his glasses,\nthen runs on. Into the smoke and flame. Out of which Scarface now appears -- in his killing wrath.\n\nTONY\nRebenga!\n\nRebenga snaps to the sound of the voice.\n\nTONY\n(Spanish)\nFrom the friends you fucked!\n\nThe work is fast. The stiletto punches nine quick holes in his lungs and his heart...  And the figure of death is gone.\n\n...And Emilio Rebenga staggers wildly in the smoke, uncomprehending eyes encased in broken glasses. Sinking out of frame.\n\n26 EXT. FREEDOMTOWN - DAY\nThe riot is over. The grounds are still, smoke and debris the aftermath.\n\nDISSOLVE TO\n\n27 INT. PROCESSING ROOM - DAY - A MONTH LATER\n\nAn Immigration Officer passes a sheaf of documents across a desk into a pair of hands. The camera gliding along a Green Card pinned to the top of the stack.\n\nIt says \"ANTHONY MONTANA\" and it has picture and stamps. It's official, as the camera moves with triumphant immigration theme music to the face of Mr. Montana examining quite contentedly the rewards of his efforts.\n\nEnd of montage. Music continues.\n\nDISSOLVE TO\n\n27-A EXT. DOWNTOWN MIAMI - SUNNY DAY\nThe new Miami is rising ubiquitously above Biscayne Bay,\nthe camera moving past blossoming skyscrapers, workmen,\nhuge cranes, glass, mirrors booming upwards into a\nbeautiful blue Florida sky, fleeced with perfectly white\nclouds... past a giant billboard:\n\nHOW ABOUT A MILLION DOLLAR LOAN?\nCOME TALK TO US...\nAT THE BANCO DE MIAMI...\nTODAY!\n\nPast banks of glass (Caribank, Banco de Venezuela, Amerifirst)...\n\nInsert a car sticker going by with the image of the American flag and the reminder: \"Will the last American leaving Miami please bring flag?\"\n\nTony and Manny bop along the street in their hand-me-down\nclothes, oogling the chicas and the bodegas (in a plush\nmodern area of Miami). Boats. Buildings. Cars.\n\nTONY\n(looking around)\nBoy -- can you believe this place, Chico?\n\nMANNY\n(Spanish)\nMan, they weren't kidding around.\n\nTONY\n(pointing to a little old man walking towards them)\nSee that old guy over there?\n\nMANNY\nYeah.\n\nTONY\nMillionaire.\n\nMANNY\nHow do you know?\n\nTONY\nGo over there.

You wanna score one of these chicks, watch me. Mira!\n\nHe wiggles his tongue up and down, fast like a small\nwhirring motor part, then slips it back into his mouth in\nthe flick of an eye.\n\nTONY\n...the fuck was that?\n\nMANNY\nYou didn't see it? You weren't looking. Hey you gotta watch for it.\n\nDoes it again, quickly; it looks like a baby robin's head\npeeking out of a nest in his teeth, then it's gone.\n\nTONY\nWhat the hell's that for -- eating bugs? That's disgustin'.\n\nMANNY\nYou think so hunh? Well you don't know shit 'bout chicks Chico. When they see this, they know. They go crazy. They don't resist me.\n\nDoes it again. Tony tries but lacks the speed and agility, provoking Manny's laughter. Many double checks himself in a shop window.\n\nMANNY\n(doing it again)\nTakes practice, mi sangre, but they just love it when you flop that pussy with it....\n\nTONY\nOooh... cono! How 'bout that one?\n\nPointing to a tall, cool blonde across the avenue.\n\nMANNY\nNo problem.\n\n27-B EXT. MIAMI SHOPPING STREET - DAY\nTony walks right out into the avenue, sticking out his arm\nand stopping traffic. Cars honk angrily but he couldn't\ngive a shit.\n\nTONY\nCome on?\n\nManny follows as Tony now moves across the opposite lane, a\ncar screeching to a halt in front of him.\n\nTONY\n(points)\nOkay Rober Retfor, strut your stuff.\n\nThe blonde has paused to look in a shop window.\n\nManny stops alongside, pretends to look. When he catches\nher eyes, he flicks his tongue.\n\nShe looks at him, confused, then back into the window.\nManny look back at Tony, winks, sidles closer to her.\n\nTony, waiting off to the side, catches the gaze of a somber\nchild, four, toddling along with it's mom. He makes his\nown version of a funny face at the kid who looks back at\nhim puzzled. Tony produces another face. The kid now\nsmiles. The mother looks over. Tony shrugs. She smiles\nand moves along.\n\nMeanwhile, Manny has moved close to the blonde and suggests something, his eyebrows raising, the smile crooked. It takes a moment, then the blonde smacks him across the face\nand walks away.\n\nTony walks over to him, mocking.\n\nTONY\nPobre hijo de puta -- you got it all mixed up.\nThis country first you gotta get the money, then you get\nthe power and when you got the power, then you get the women -- and then, Chico, you got the world by the balls. Por los conjones.\n\nMANNY\nThere you go talking big again man. You don't know shit about the world.

It combines the social functions of a family restaurant, cafe, tourist haunt and late-night watering hole for various beasts of prey.\n\nThe waitresses move like well-oiled troops along the paths\nto the kitchen, turning the tables at a speedy rate. The\ncamera following past the pots and the pans and the steam\nand the yelling cooks -- to the deepest, darkest recess of\nthis dungeon....\n\n. . . To reveal Tony Montana stubbing grease off the pots and\nManny Ray washing a stack of dishes. They're filthy and\nexhausted. A dish slips through Manny's fingers and crashes\nto the floor. A look between them suffices to tell us all.\n\nTONY\nYour big shot friend better come up with something soon. I didn't come to America to break my fucking back, querido.\n\nMANNY\n(equally irritated)\nHey he's coming okay! What do you want?\n\nCUT TO\n\n29 INT./EXT. LITTLE HAVANA RESTAURANT - NIGHT - HOURS LATER\nWe are looking through a cubbyhole at the diners. Young\nCuban guys with chiquitas drift in with their fancy clothes,\ndiamonds and -- the mark of status -- large bodyguards.\nThey're out front with the flash, shaking hands with friends, kissing, talking loud, familiar with the waitresses.\n\nStaring through the smeared window enrapt are Tony and\nManny, wiping the sweat off their faces with towels.\n\nMANNY\nLook at that chick man, wow! Look at them knockers.\n\nTONY\nYeah, look at the punk with her.\nWhat's he got that I don't got?\n\nMANNY\nHe's good-looking that's what, look at his clothes, flash Chico, pizzazz!

You got company...\n\nMANNY\nThat's him -- El Mono's here!\n\nTONY\n(contemptuous of the name)\nEl Mono? Shit....\n\nCUT TO\n30 EXT. PARKING LOT OUTSIDE LITTLE HAVANA RESTAURANT - NIGHT\nOmar Suarez (El Mono -- \"The Monkey\") is so named cause he\nlooks like one. Nervous, crooked, darting eyes, feverish\nintelligence, constantly smoking a cigarette and coughing\nbetween words, his face pock-marked and pitted like the moon from an old acne scars, he cuts a skinny figure at the wheel of a big beige Coupe De Ville, idling the motor... with him is Waldo Rojas eating a large foot and a half banana. In contrast he's amiable, heavyset with a receding hairline, flashing a lot of gold when he smiles.\n\nMANNY\n(leaning in the window)\nHey Omar, Waldo, coma esta... my friend I told you about. Tony Montana... Omar Suarez, Waldo Rojas....\n\nWaldo mumbles something indistinct, Omar just stares briefly as Tony hangs back, nodding arrogantly. Omar's eyes move back to Manny.\n\nOMAR\nI got something for you.\n\nMANNY\nOh yeah! That's great... What do we gotta do?\n\nOMAR\nWe gotta unload a boat -- grass, twenty-five tons -- that's what we gotta do. You get five hundred each.\n\nMANNY\nOkay!\n(to Tony)\nSee, what'd I tell you.\n\nTONY\nYou gotta be kidding! Whaddayou think we are -- baggage handlers?\n\nOmar looks at him somewhat incredulously as Tony wipes his hands on his greasy apron as he talks.\n\nTONY\n...five hundred dollars -- shit!\nWhat'd I do for you guys in the slammer, hunh? What was the Rebenga hit -- game of dominoes or somethin'? You're talkin' to important guys here.\n\nMANNY\n(shocked)\nHey Tony, c'mon, it's okay Omar, we...\n\nTONY\nShaddup!\n\nOmar sniggers, his eyes shifting to Waldo who shakes his\nhead and laughs.\n\nOMAR\n(to Manny only)\nSo what's it with this dishwasher, Chico?

MIAMI BEACH - DAY - MOVING SHOT\nThe somewhat run-down, art-deco cheaper hotels of South\nMiami Beach. The porches are filled with senior citizens\nplaying cards, reading papers, staring, slowly walking the\nstreet.\n\nThe ramshackle sedan, jammed with Tony and his gang,\nrattles past. It's a beaten-up black and blue Monte Carlo,\njacked up on its springs with dune buggy threads and\nneeding paint. You'd arrest these guys on sight.\n\n32 INT./EXT. TONY'S CADILLAC - MIAMI BEACH - DAY\nseen from the inside of the sedan. Tony turns down the salsa beat on the radio, smoking a cigarette tensely. Manny is driving. In the dilapidated backseat are Angel, the baby-faced punk, and Chi-Chi, both from Freedomtown.\n\nManny, reflecting the tension, whistles a rapid series of notes under his breath as he waits for a light to change.\n\nMANNY\nHey look at that chick, hunh? Lookit those tits man, she's begging for it!\n\nAt the curb, an old crone hunchbacks her way in front of the teenage chick, who is coming off the beach in a bikini, blocking her off.\n\nCHI-CHI\n(looking over)\nWhatta you crazy? She's 103 years old.\n\nMANNY\nNot her stupido! Her....\n\nCamera revealing the teenager.\n\nTONY\n(the light changing)\nDrive, willya.\n\nMANNY\n(mocking)\nSure, sure. Not to worry, Tony -- You get a heart attack.\n(looking in the rearview mirror)\nAngel, whatcha wearing the face for?\n\nANGEL\n(tense, making light of it)\nAh, it's okay. I just y'know forgot to make an offering. I was supposed to go by the madrina today.\n\nMANNY\nYou still going to that cuncha?\n\nANGEL\nShe knows her shit. She talks to Yemaya and Chango like nobody y'ever heard.\n\nAs he talks Angel fingers a Negrita charm hanging around\nhis neck -- Chango, God of Fire and Thunder, his black face\ntilted at a carnal angle. Sharp teeth glinting, his eyes\nrolling in orgasmic imagery, his head crowned with gold.\nMany of the Marielitos in the film will be wearing this,\nalso pendants with an eye to ward off the evil spirits, red\nand white beads, red kerchiefs, black hand charms silver-\nbangled bracelets, etc., all relating to their Afro-Catholic\nspiritualism.\n\nMANNY\n(making fun)\nYeah, Chango looking out for us,\n\nCHI-CHI\nAngel?\n\nANGEL\nChango looking out for all the 'bandidos' everywhere. But you gotta pay him his dues, y'know. You gotta let him know you respect him. You don't, Chango -- he gets pissed an'...\n\nTONY\n(angry)\nHey, shaddup -- all of ya! I told you before I don't go for that mystical voodoo shit. That's for the old cunchas waving their rooster cocks in some dark alley, There's no gods, there's no Chango -- nowhere! You make your own luck. So shaddup and act like you're in the United States here.\n\nSilence. Through the windshield, the sign of a motel -- THE SUN RAY -- is coming closer.\n\nTONY\nOkay, this is it. Pull over across the street.\nThe motel is coming closer in silence.\n\nTONY\n(to Manny)\nMoney stays in the trunk till I come out and get it. Me. Nobody else. If I'm not out in fifteen minutes, something's wrong. I'm in Room 9. You ready, Angelito?\n\nANGEL\nSure thing.\n\nAs Manny pulls the car up, they pull out Ingram Model-10\nmachine pistol with folding butt and suppressor, ten inches\nof kill power capable of firing 1100 rounds a minute -- it\ncan be slipped into a man's purse, it's in vogue. Tony getting out, to Angel:\n\nTONY\nLet's go....\n\nCUT TO\n\n33 EXT. SUN-RAY MOTEL - DAY\nTony and Angel come slowly, gingerly down an exterior\ncorridor to a room marked \"9\". Nodding to Angel who remains in the stairwell with the Ingram machine pistol, Tony knocks.\nPause.\n\n34 EXT. TOAD'S MOTEL ROOM - DAY\nThe door's opened casually by an ugly, squat five-foot-four-inch Colombian, \"The Toad\". He's in his forties, sports shirt hanging over his polyester pants, old acne scars on his face, like Omar; he's good natured, a nice guy, he smiles.\n\nTOAD\nHey, oye amigo....\n\nSpreading his arms in such a fashion to indicate he's clean.\n\n35 INT. TOAD'S MOTEL ROOM - DAY\nTony, stepping into the conventionally tasteless orange and\nblue motel room (with heavy blue drapes blocking the windows), spreads his hands in a similar posture indicating he too is not carrying; but this is only symbolic, it's not meant to be a body search.\n\nTONY\n(as he steps in)\nHow you doing amigo...?\n\nThe other person in the room is a tough-looking little dark\nColombian chick with expressionless eyes, red fingernails, and short boy-cut hair, \"The Lizard\"; she's tinier than the Toad, about five-two.\n\nThe Toad looks around the corridor, eases the door closed.\n\nTONY\n(checking out the room)\nMind leaving the door open so my brothers know everything's okay... okay?\n\nToad shrugs and readjusts, leaving it open a few inches,\nthe conversation clipped and nervous throughout the scene.\n\nTOAD\nSure, no problem... This is Marta.\n\nTONY\nHello, Marta.\nShe nods woodenly, stays across the room. Behind her, the\ntelevision set is on to the Cable Newswatch. The protagonists\nintermittently flick their eyes to it, soothing the tension.\n\nTOAD\nI'm Hector...\n\nPause.\n\nTONY\nYeah. I'm Tony. So Omar says you're okay.\n\nTOAD\nYeah, Omar's okay.\n\nTONY\nYou know Omar.\n\nTOAD\nOmar, yeah, I talk to him on the phone.\n\nTONY\nOkay...\n\nTOAD\nOkay... so you got the money?\n\nTONY\nYeah, you got the stuff?\n\nTOAD\nSure I got the stuff, but I don't\ngot it right here with me. I got it\nclose by.\n\nTONY\nYeah well I don't got it either, I\ngot it close by, too.\n\nTOAD\nWhere, in the parking lot?\n\nTONY\nNo. How far's your stuff?\n\nTony paces back towards, the door casually, to check Angel\nout... The Lizard staring at him...\n\nTOAD\nNot far.\n\nPause. Everything seems okay.\n\nTONY\nSo what do we do, walk in and start over?\n\nTOAD\n(changes subject)\nWhere you from?\n\nTony's eyes check out the bathroom.\n\nTONY\nWhat fuckin' difference does it make where I'm from?\n\nTOAD\nI like to get to know who I do business with.\n\nIt's like he's stalling for time. The Lizard has made a\nmove somewhere off-center and is now sitting on the bed,\ncoiled and always watching.\n\nTONY\nYou get to know me when you start doing business and not fucking around, Hector.\n\nTOAD\nHey I'm just a friendly guy, maybe you don't...\n\nTONY\nOkay, what's the stall here? Your guy late or something?\n\n36 INT. TOAD'S MOTEL ROOM - DAY\nThere's suddenly a door slamming somewhere outside, then\ncommotion.\n\nANGEL\nTony!\n\nTony goes for his cheap handgun when he hears a frightening\nfemale shriek, like a bird.\n\nLIZARD\n(slang Spanish)\nDon't! Get up! Now shithead!\n\nShe's standing there with a .32 pointed steady at him, the eyes like angry steel. There's no mistaking her ability to shoot.\n\nThe Toad pulls a 9mm out of the small of his back, approaches Tony. Angel is shoved into the room, followed by two more\nColumbians, \"The Kids\".\n\nThey slam the door, both carrying Uzis with silencers, neither of them higher than five-four or older than twenty, with their straight black Indian hair cut across their blank eyes, they look like hungry little piranha careless about killing, muttering with the Lizard in fast Columbese slang.\n\nAs Toad strips the handgun from Tony:\n\nTONY\nFrog face, you just fucked up. You steal from me, you're dead.\n\nToad shrugs, he couldn't care less.\n\nTOAD\nYeah, okay, you gonna give me the cash or am I gonna kill your brother first? 'Fore I kill you?\n\nTONY\nWhy don't you try sticking your head up your ass? See if it fits\n\nToad, completing the body search, rips out the stiletto\ntaped to the small of Tony's back. As he mutters something\nin hard Columbian slang to the two kids who shove Angel\ninto the bathroom, producing strands of thick rope.\nEven more worrisome is the chainsaw that the Lizard now\npulls out of the suitcase under the bed. Toad begins\nassembling it as Lizard, still covering Tony with her gun, completes the deadpan process by turning up the volume on the television set. The news, ironically not in Miami, is about a drug-related triple-homicide.\n\nCUT TO:\n\n37 EXT. SUN-RAY MOTEL - DAY\n\nChi-Chi sitting at the wheel of the sedan, parked across\nthe street. Manny paces outside the car, glances.\n\n38 EXT.

TOAD'S MOTEL ROOM - DAY\nAngel hangs suspended on the ropes from the top of the shower curtain bar, his legs straddling the edge of the bathtub. Toad slaps a tape over his mouth.\n\nTony, covered by the two kids, watches from the lip of the\nbathroom. He bucks angrily but the two kids ram their\npistols up against his temple and pin him to the door.\nAngel looks at Tony; the eyes between them steady. They're\ndead and they know it.\n\nToad, well-prepared, connects a voltage adapter and extension cord.\n\nTOAD\n(to Tony)\nYou watch what happens to your friend okay? If you don't want this to happen to you, you get the money.\n\nLizard reenters the room, shakes her head at the Toad who\nnods and turns on the whirring machine.\n\nThe Toad smiles amiably and angles the chainsaw slowly\ntowards Angel.\n\nThe two kids press tight against Tony, guns pointed at his\nbrains... Off-camera, we know what's happening as we hear the chainsaw and we watch Tony's shock and rage.\n\nLizard has no expression on her face. The machine cuts off.\n\nThe Toad steps back from the tub, blood splattered on his shirt, examining his first cut like a butcher. He glances at Tony.\n\nTOAD\nNow the leg, hunh?\n\nA brief glimpse of Angel slumped by one arm like a cow on a strap, streaming blood, eyes conscious and horrified; a terrifying sight. The chainsaw whirrs once more.\n\nCUT TO\n\n41 EXT. SUN-RAY MOTEL - DAY\nManny, definitely suspecting something now, moves with\nChi-Chi across the parking lot of the Sun-Ray Motel. They\nsignal and separate.\n\nCUT TO\n\n42 INT. TOAD'S MOTEL ROOM - DAY\nThe Toad turns off the chainsaw and steps back, now drenched with Angel's blood, totally unaffected. He looks at Tony.\n\nTony glances back at him with fury, tears involuntarily dotting his eyes.\n\nTOAD\nOkay, my 'caracortada', you can die too. Makes no difference to me.\n\nHe nods. The kids shove Tony forward and we glimpse Angel\nlying hunkered at his feet in the bathtub, in the steam of\nhis blood, piss dead.\n\nCUT TO\n\n43 EXT. SUN-RAY MOTEL - DAY\nManny moves crouched down the exterior corridor, Ingram\npistol in hand, past an older couple who pretend not to\nnotice.\n\nAt the door of Room 9, Manny waits, listens...\n\nCUT TO\n\n44 INT.

Everything happens very fast now.\n\nManny is at the lip of the bathroom, he fires and hits kid\none, who is turning, in the neck.\n\nTony, not tied up yet, spins on kid two and smashes the unloosened strap across his face, sending him reeling across the bathroom.\n\nThe Toad, chainsaw in hand, slashes at Manny.\n\nManny fires a burst into him and the Toad crashes backwards.\n\nManny now spins into a wall, hit in the side.\n\nThe Lizard, wounded on her knees, is firing her .32 at\nhim. In the background, the window simultaneously blows out as Chi-Chi appears firing a burst with his Ingram.\n\nIn sharp foreground, the Lizard crumples forward on her knees, foaming blood.\n\nTony, with the tape still stuck across his mouth, smashes kid two, pinned against the blood-stained sink, with the stock of his own Ingram.\n\nIn the midst of this, the Toad jumps up, wounded but with strength, he tears out the motel room door hysterical, gripping the whirring chainsaw in a reflex action.\n\nChi-Chi, climbing through the window, fires at him.\n\nMeanwhile, kid two, with a rattlesnake life in him, produces\na knife out of nowhere, just missing Tony's gut by a half-second as Tony dances back, getting a grip on the machine pistol.\n\nHe blows kid two away point-blank, putting another ten craters in the mirror of the now-wrecked motel room.\n\nTony, yelling, whirls after the Toad.\n\nTONY\nI got him!\n\nManny, holding his side, empties his pistol on kid one, who is still twitching.\n\nChi-Chi sees Angel, gags.\n\nCUT TO\n46 EXT. SUN-RAY MOTEL - DAY 46\nThe senior citizens, playing Mahjong on the porch, mutter\nin astonishment, as the Toad staggers out into the parking lot, blood flying, chainsaw in hand, moving like a jerky chicken.\n\nTheir eyes follow.\n\nAs Tony comes out, walking after him deliberately, eyes set in cold fury, machine gun swinging loosely at his side.\nThere's no rush, no fear of the police, getting even is all\nthat counts. He stands behind the Toad.\n\nTONY\n(Spanish)\nYour turn, cabron!\n\nThe Toad whips around to the voice, eyes stark with terror.\n\nTony empties the clip into the Toad, blowing him apart.\n\nThe bystanders just stare, stunned by the ferocity. Then\nan old lady faints.\n\nThe Toad's body lying awkwardly arched in the gutter, Tony\nturns and with a passing disinterested glimpse at his\naudience, calmly walks back into the motel; the distance\nand the light sufficient to conceal Tony's possible identification.\n\nCUT TO\n\n47 EXT. SUN-RAY MOTEL - DAY\nTony intersects Manny holding his side, with Chi-Chi.\n\nTONY\nManny, you okay?\n\nManny nods.\n\nTONY\nChi-Chi, get the car. Fast!\n\nCHI-CHI\nSi!\n\n48 INT. TOAD'S MOTEL ROOM\nTony strides into the shambles of Room 9, past the bodies\nand busted furniture to the suitcase on the bed from which\nthe Lizard pulled the chainsaw. The TV news still plays in the corner.\n\nInside are several kilo-sized stacks of cocaine.\n\nHe shuts the suitcase, exits, stops, looks in the bathroom at the corpse of Angel off-camera. He goes, stoops, brings Angel's Change charm into our view, fingers it, tosses it back in the tub. He goes.\n\nCUT TO\n49 EXT. SUN-RAY MOTEL - DAY\n\nChi-Chi has the sedan waiting in the parking lot. Tony\nhurries out, jumps in, the car speeding off. (Pisalo hasta la tabla -- Step on it.)\n\nPast the senior citizens who are retreating inside their\nrooms.\n\nThe camera swinging to hold on the blue and black Monte Carlo disappearing into the traffic of the Strip as two cop cars\ncome screaming past them from the opposite direction.\n\nCUT TO\n50 EXT.

LOPEZ CONDO - NIGHT 52\nA deluxe apartment with the latest in electronic security and surveillance, and a profusion of mirrors and luxury items... and a hefty, Indian-looking bodyguard (Ernie), eyes quietly trained like a Doberman pinscher.\n\nThe boss, Frank Lopez, comes down a carpeted corridor, dressed for dinner in an expensive suit and shoes, somewhat preoccupied as he greets Tony, then Manny, with a phony effusion of warmth. He's of Cuban-Jewish extraction, now Americanized in a rough and handsome sort of way, on the heavy side, the face going slightly soft, but the eyes and bulk carrying an odor of danger about him.\n\nLOPEZ\nHow ya doing, Tony? Glad to meet you. How 'bout a drink?\n\nTONY\nMr. Lopez... real pleasure.\n\nLOPEZ\nCall me Frank, Tony. Everybody calls me Frank. My Little League team, even the prosecutors 'round town, they all call me Frank.\n\nTONY\nOkay Frank.\n\nFrank shakes hands with Manny.\n\nLOPEZ\nHowya doing?\n\nMANNY\n(awed)\n...Fine yeah.\n\nTONY\nManny Ray, he was with us on the job.\n\nLOPEZ\n(to Manny)\nI hear you caught one?\n\nManny shrugs, works his arm, showing us the wound doesn't bother him too much.\n\nMANNY\nJust the flesh. Went right through.\n\nLOPEZ\n(heading for the bar)\nYeah, Omar here tells me good things about you boys.\n\nTONY\n(glances at Omar)\nYeah. Omar's terrific.\n\nLOPEZ\nNot to mention of course the nice job you guys did for me on that Commie sonufabitch Emilio Rebenga.\n\nTONY\nYou don't have to mention it. That was fun.\n\nLOPEZ\n(smiles, likes the kid's balls)\nScotch? Gin? Rum?\n\nTONY\nGin's fine.\n\nLOPEZ\n(pouring)\nYeah, I need a guy with steel in his balls. I need him close to me, a guy like you Tony -- and your compadre here.\n\nTONY\nYeah... well.\n\nStill a little overwhelmed by the opulence of the place, his clothes feeling narrow and cheap on him, Tony steps forward and puts the suitcase up on the bar with the gin, which Lopez passes to him, eyeing the suitcase.\n\nTONY\n...that's it. That's the two keys. Angel died 'cause of this shit. And here's the money.\n(produces the money)\nIt's my gift to you -- from me.\n\nPause. Lopez shakes his head, sighs.\n\nLOPEZ\nIt's too bad about your friend, Tony, if people'd do business the right way, there'd be no fuckups like this....\n\nHe glances hard at Omar who squirms.\n\nWithout opening it, Lopez signals the bodyguard who takes\nthe suitcase and the money from under Tony's nose.\n\nLOPEZ\nDon't think I don't appreciate this gesture, Tony. You find in this business, you stay loyal you move up and you move up fast. Salud!\n\nThey drink the toast.

When she's not looking. What do you say guys, to a little food?\n(finishes his drink at his impatient pace)\n\nTONY\nYeah sure, I could eat a horse.\n\nERNIE\nHere she comes, Mr. Lopez.\n\nTONY looks up, his eyes tumbling on the most beautiful blonde he's ever seen. The lady, is coming down the glassed-in elevator, adjusting her $10,000 Yves St. Laurent burgundy dinner dress.\n\nLOPEZ\nOooh sweetheart, you look like a million bucks.\n\nShe doesn't answer, her eyes flicking disinterestedly over to Tony and Manny, knowing what the evening's going to be and not too happy about it.\n\n**ALTERNATIVE**\nLOPEZ\nWhere you been baby, it's ten o'clock, I'm hungry.\n\nELVIRA\nYou're always hungry, you should try starving.\n\nLopez laughs.\n\nLOPEZ\nI want you to meet a friend of mine.\nTony Montana...

I got nothing but friends.\n\nELVIRA\nYou never know, do you? Maybe the catcher on your Little League team.\n\nNeatly avoiding his intended smooch, she slips by him towards the door, her throat flashing a $20,000 strip of jewelry.\n\nELVIRA\nCome on, Frank, let's go.\n\nTracking a cool, polished hauteur, she exits the apartment.\n\nLopez, after a pause, snaps at his men.\n\nLOPEZ\nOkay, let's go.\n\nCUT TO\n54 EXT. THE BABYLON CLUB - NIGHT\nWe know this is no workingman's dive when Lopez piles them\nout of his Rolls, and the carhops are moving Bugattis, Lamborghinis and Corniches in a long snaking line down the driveway. Single girls in high-collared silver lame jumpsuits with cinched waists, prowl like big glistening tents back and forth across the entry doors, rich young coiffed playboys in their Porsches honking their horns in appreciation. Brain drain.\n\n55 INT. BABYLON CLUB - NIGHT\nThe interior is built like three or four plush apartments that run together on three separate levels with imaginative angles, mirrors, swimming pool, bars, twenty-piece band, hundreds of tropical plants, dance floor, video games, computers and a restaurant. It's a lavish fun spot that will play a central role in the film, a drug dealer haven and nighttime capital of South America.\n\nThe crowd, a combination of Caucasian and Latin, is mostly\nyoung, rich and happy and a lot of them coked; the girls, upperclass in sleek dresses, trim figures, heels, hats, sensuous bodies, yell as they dance to a black American music beat, \"Celebrating\" or \"Partying Down Tonight\".\n\nThe waitresses, mostly blondes, wear little coca channel\nhats pinned to their heads and the barest pants with hose\nand high heels.\n\nRich young guys with a lot of gold and diamonds on their\nnecks and hands huddle briefly in groups or chat.\n\nDown at the vid games are younger chicks in jeans and\ntough-looking tank tops with \"Motherfuckah\" and \"Fuck Me\"\nwritten on them. Manny's coming from the toilets, tries to pick one of them up.\n\nMANNY\nSo whaddaya say, hunh?\n\nHe flashes his tongue. She looks at him, amused.\n\nCHICK\nYou got a buck?\n\nMANNY\nSure I got a buck, whaddaya think I am, poor?\n\nCHICK\n(indicates the machine)\nPut it in, let's play.\n\nMANNY\nI had other things in mind.\n\nCHICK\nYou check out on this and we'll talk about other things.\n\nMANNY\n(looks off, concerned, then confronts the complex machine)\nFuck, how do you play this thing?\n\nCUT TO\n56 INT. BABYLON CLUB 56\nFrank Lopez, intoxicated, takes his heart pill with a slug\nof champagne. He sits next to Tony, who is agog at all this wealth. Omar and Ernie look on. Elvira is in conversation with a girl friend who has stopped by. They're sitting at the best table in the place, finishing up a giant meal. The empty spot belongs to Manny.\n\nLOPEZ\n(to Tony)\nOver there that's Ronnie Echeverria.\nHim and his brother Miguel, they got a big distribution set-up here to Houston and Tucson....\n\nTheir point of view -- Ronnie Echevarria, powerful, competent looking man in conversation with a party of people.\n\nLOPEZ\nThat guy there, in the purple shirt -- Gaspar Gomez. Bad news. Stone killer there ever was one. Stay away.\n\nTheir point of view -- Gaspar Gomez at a table with another\nguy and gorgeous woman.\n\nLOPEZ\n...the fat guy, with the chicas is Nacho Contreras -- El Gordo. Wouldn't know it to look at him but he's got more cash than anybody in here. A real haza....\n\nTheir point of view -- El Gordo is fat, dressed like a cheap slob and playing up to a bunch of chicas.\n\nLOPEZ\n. ..you know what a haza is, Tony?\n\nTONY\n'Haza'? No Frank, what's a haza?\n\nLOPEZ\nIt's Yiddish for pig. It's a guy he's got more'n what he needs, so he don't fly straight anymore, y'know. That's the problem in this business, Tony, there's too many 'hazas' and they're the ones you got to watch out for. If they can fuck you outta an extra dime, they'll rip you and flip you and then fuck you with a stick for the pure pleasure of it. See it all comes down to one thing, Tony boy, never forget it! Lesson number one -- don't underestimate the other guy's greed.\n\nELVIRA\nLesson number two -- don't get high on your own supply.\n\nThe girl friend has departed and Elvira turns her attention back to them, bored.\n\nLOPEZ\nThat's right.

BABYLON CLUB - NIGHT\nA Man passes the table. Lopez calls out.\n\nLOPEZ\nHey, George -- buddy.\n\nMAN\nHey, Frank.. -how's the case coming?\n\nThe Man's eyes thread the table. He looks sharp, heavy-lidded, cigarette-eyed, his voice a hoarse croak, a cigarette dangling from his mouth, his manner cool but amicable with Lopez. This is George Sheffield, Miami lawyer.\n\nLOPEZ\nOy, I shoulda come to you 'stead of that putz, Neufeld.\n\nSHEFFIELD\nJack's a good lawyer.

Her eyes say forget it.\n\nELVIRA\n(to Tony)\nHow about you?\n\nTony nods sure, looks at his boss.\n\nLOPEZ\n(waves)\nGo on!\n\nThey go.\n\n58 INT. BABYLON CLUB - NIGHT\nIt's interesting to watch Tony walk to the floor, leading Elvira. It's not so much an act of walking as it is an act of war, a tank bouncing anything or anybody off that gets in the way. Be just proceeds in a straight dead line, eyes forward. It's not that he doesn't see the people he bumps off, it's that he couldn't care less.\n\nLOPEZ\n(to Omar)\nWhat do you think?\n\nOMAR\nI think he's a fucking peasant.\n\nLOPEZ\nYeah -- but you get guys like that on your side, they break their backs for you.\n\nCUT TO\n59 INT.

You got a nice face, you got great legs, you got the fancy clothes and you got this look in your eyes like you haven't been fucked good in a year. What's the problem, baby?\n\nElvira laughs at him, furious.\n\nELVIRA\nYou know you're even stupider than you look. Let me give you a crash course, Jose whatever your name is, so you know what you're doing around here.\n\nTONY\n(interrupting)\nNow you're talking to me, baby!\n\nELVIRA\nFirst who, where, why and how I fuck is none of your business, second don't call me 'baby,' I'm not your baby and last, even if I was blind, desperate, starved and begging for it on a desert island, you'd be the last thing I'd ever fuck.

Tony, that's Lopez's lady. He'll kill us.\n\nTONY\nWhat are you kidding -- he's soft.\nI seen it in his face -- booze and a cuncha tells him what to do.\n\nPause.\n\n63-A OMITTED\n\n64 EXT.

MIAMI SHOPPING STREET - DAY.\n\nTony walks right out into the avenue, sticking out his arms and stopping traffic. Cars honk angrily but he couldn't give a shit.\n\nTONY\nCome on!\n\nManny follows as Tony now moves across the opposite lane, a\ncar screeching to a halt in front of him.\n\nTONY\n(points)\nOkay Rober Retfor, strut your stuff.\n\nThe blonde has paused to look in a shop window.\n\nManny stops alongside, -pretends to look. When he catches\nher eyes, he flicks his tongue.\n\nShe looks at him, confused, then back into the window.\nManny looks back at Tony, winks, sidles closer to her.\n\nTony, exiting off to the side, catches the gaze of a somber\nchild, four, toddling along with it's mom. He makes his\nown version of a funny face at the kid who looks back at\nhim puzzled. Tony produces another face. The kid now\nsmiles. The mother looks over. Tony shrugs. She smiles and moves along.\n\nMeanwhile, Manny has moved close to the blonde and suggests something, his eyebrows raising, the smile crooked. It takes a moment, then the blonde socks him across the face and walks away.\n\nTony walks up to him, mocking.\n\nTONY\nI'm telling you man you got it- all mixed up.\nThis country first, you gotta get the money; then you get the power, and when you got the power, then you get the women -- then, chico, you got the world by the balls.

TONY'S MOTHER'S LIVING ROOM - NIGHT\nThe interior is comprised of small, narrow rooms filled\nwith religious objects from macumba and waist-high black\nJesus statues in various corners. The floor is without rugs and mosaicked with inexpensive, Aztec-type tiles, the impression clean, cluttered, Catholic, somewhat depressing.\n\nStepping forward to the center of the living room like a cautious cat is his nineteen-year-old sister Gina. Their eyes lock.\n\nTONY\n(moved)\nHi Gina...\n\nGINA\nTony?\n\nShe looks at her mother confused. She's a naturally dark,\ncurly-headed beauty with a slim, graceful figure and\nlarge-lidded eyes brimming with the same energy as Tony's.\n(She might also be recognizable from the snapshot we saw in\nTony's possession.)\n\nTONY\n(covering his unwanted emotion)\nYeah, look at you, you're beautiful... what's it been seven years?

She stares at it, doesn't take it. Gina comes over, takes it for her.\n\nGINA\nIt's beautiful... Mama,\n(offers it, an unspoken 'why don't you take it?')\n\nMama doesn't. Gina puts it away with her own.\n\nTONY\n(holding Gina by the shoulder, making light of it)\nWell anyway, here we are hunh? The three musketeers! We made it to America hunh?

So leave us alone... go on, get out! And take this lousy\nmoney with you, it stinks!\n\nShe casts the bundle of bills back across the table at him\nlike dead lettuce.\n\nA silence.

I wouldn't buy the car you didn't like it.\n\nELVIRA\nPlanning on driving the girls crazy, aren't you?\n\nTONY\nYeah -- you know who.\nThey get in the car.\n\nELVIRA\nAnd what would Frank say?\n\nShe has a coke vial out, casually hits one nostril, then\nother, then takes a last hit through the mouth.\n\nTONY\nI like Frank.. -but I like you better.\n\nHe reaches over and takes the coke from her. Does a toot,\nstaring at her. She's uncomfortable. When he finishes he ,\nmakes as if to return it to her. She leans to take it. He\nkisses her. She goes with it.\n\nPause. She pulls back.\n\nELVIRA\n(same tone of voice as before)\nDon't get confused, Tony. I don't fuck around with the help.\n\nAs he puts the key into the ignition, Tony has this wolfish grin on his face.\n\nCUT TO\nINT. COCAINE LAB - BOLIVIA - DAY 93\nSubtitle appears:\n\nCOCHABAMBA, BOLIVA\nAlejandro Sosa is a playboy, about six-foot-two, black wavy\nhair, athletic body and a Copacabana tan, the clothes, a\ncasual polo shirt and the latest pants from Calvin Klein.\n\nOn his wrist is a flashy gold ID bracelet with \"Alex' written in diamonds and on the other wrist a gold Rolex with a bezel full of diamonds worth maybe $30,000. His eyes fizzle with an energy derived not from drugs but the continual excitement of his toys and his money.\n\nAccompanying him everywhere is the Shadow, a thin, intense\nvenomous-looking Hispanic man in his thirties, he has the\nlook of death in an unsmiling face. He is always in\nproximity to his Jefe, usually slightly behind the person\nor persons addressing Sosa -- in a sort of garotte\nposition, his eyes swiveling to stare down the person who\nmight glance at him. He is a continual source of tension\nunderplaying the scenes, particularly coming to affect Omar\nwho is insecure to begin with.\n\nSosa is showing Tony and Omar through his coke processing\nlab, past four coal-fired stoves, each with massive iron\nkettles bubbling with coca paste... across to a row of ovens\nwhere the refined coke dries. The chemists and Indians\nworking there all acknowledge llel rey de1 rey\" as he passes, as proud of his factory as a vine grower his vineyard.\n\nSOSA\nSo this and my other factory can guarantee production of 200\nkilos refined every month of the year. Problem is, I have no steady\nmarket. Some months I can't get rid of fifty keys, other months I have to do 2 to 300 keys, it's crazy, hunh? Nobody can run a business that way ---\n\nOMAR\nI know what you mean Mr. Sosa, we got the same problems up in Miami, the demand varies for us too, month to month...\n\nSosa looks at him like that's obvious and moves on. In his\nskinny suit, with the wet cigarette clamped between his\nnervous fingers, Omar's not quite in his league with Sosa.\n\nTony, awed by the scope of it all, follows along, stops to\nlook at a sample of the dried coke.\nThe Shadow stops, eyeballs him.\n\nTony eyeballs him back, playing a game with him, then\nsamples the coke off his thumb into his nose.\nPause. His expression says I like it. He moves on.\nThe Shadow moves with him.\n\nSOSA\n(meanwhile)\n...Basically what I'm looking for is somebody to share the risks with me, somebody in the States who might guarantee me something like -- say 150 kilos a month.\n\nOMAR\nThat's a big commitment Mr. Sosa. It's too bad Frank's not here. Something like that you should talk to him.\n\nSOSA\nYes, it would've been nice if he could have come.\n\nTONY\n(cutting in)\nand he'd like meeting you too Mr. Sosa. But with his trial coming up y'know, it's not so easy for him to slip outta the country right now, y'understand?\n\nSOSA\n(taking the measure of Tony, sarcastic)\nSo he sent you?\n\nTONY\nYeah, something like that. You sure got good stuff in there Mr. Sosa -- class A shit.\n\nLooking over the laboratory like it was his.\nOmar glances at him, annoyed.\n\nSOSA\nWe'll talk at my house. Shall we go...\n\nCUT TO\n94 INT. SOSA VILLA - BOLIVIA - DAY 94\nThe camera moves past a spectacular view of the mountains\nto a cavernous dining room highlighted by huge paintings\nfrom the Spanish classical period and ornate candelabra.\nAt the table are Sosa, Omar, Tony. The Shadow sits impassively in a folding chair off to the side, watching Omar and Tony. Tony is impressed, looking at the plates, the glasses, the silverware, uncomfortable, trying to fit in.\nHe eats the salmon off a silver plate with oafish movements of his knife and fork as the servants move to and fro, constantly hanging dishes, confusing Tony (ad-lib during scene).\n\nSOSA\n(to Omar)\n...say Lopez guarantees me 150 keys a month for a year, and he picks it up down here, I could sell it to him for as little as 7000 a kilo. You cannot do better than that.\n\nOMAR\nWell, we do that, we gotta take the\nrisk of moving it. Also we'd be cutting out the Columbians. You\nknow what that means?\n\nTONY\nThat means we gotta go to war with\n`em.\nlooks over at him, not quite knowing yet what to make\nSosa\nof this guy.\nSOSA\nWhen we cut out the Colombians we take risks -- on both sides.\n\nTONY\nSplit the risk. Guarantee your delivery as far as Panama.\n\nSOSA\nPanama? Risky? It costs me more. There I'd sell maybe 13.5 a key.\n\nTONY\n13.5! What are you nuts? We still gotta take the shit to Florida. You\nknow what that's like these days?\nThey got the Navy all over the fuckin' place. They got frogmen, they got EC2s with satellite tracking shit in 'em, they got fuckin' Bell 209 assault choppers up the ass, we're losing one out of every nine loads. It's no duckwalk for us anymore, y'know. Forget it.\n\nOmar is looking at him, ready to explode at his blithe assumption of power -- whereas Sosa chuckles, amused by his brashness, starting to be intrigued by this animal.\n\nSOSA\nWhat do you suggest is a fair...?\nExcuse me.\n\nInterrupted, Sosa looks over at his black aide who suddenly\nappears at the door, apparently with a message. Sosa waves\nhim in.\n\nThe black aide -- The Skull -- is a slim, tall imposing man\nwith academic, 'horn-rimmed glasses and close-cropped hair\non a huge and impressive skull. He combines the physical qualities of an animal with an intellectual. As he approaches, he glances down the table, his eyes falling briefly on Omar who doesn't connect. The Skull falters -- just for a moment -- then continues towards Sosa with the same stony, loyal expression.\n\nSosa lends his ear and the Skull whispers his information.\nA beat.\nHe whispers a second thought. Sosa reacts minimally.\nThen he nods, dismissing the Skull who heads out the room.\nSosa glances at his gold Rolex.\n\nOMAR\n(meanwhile, in a whisper to Tony)\nShaddup willya Montana, I'm doing the talking here!\n\nTony shrugs.\n\nSOSA\nWhere were we?\n\nTONY\nPanama. You're looking for a partner, right?\n\nOmar shoots a poisonous glance at Tony.\n\nSOSA\n...something like that.\n(chuckles)\n\nOMAR\nLook Mr. Sosa, we're getting ahead of ourselves here. I'm down on Frank's authority to buy 200 keys, that's it, that's my limit. I got no right to negotiate for Frank Lopez on anything larger than that. So why don't we...\n\nTONY\nHey Omar, why don't you let the man finish, hunh? Let him propose his proposition.\n\nOMAR\nHey Montana, you got no authority here, okay! I started you in this business, all right, so shut the fuck UP!\n\nTONY\n(shrugs)\nFrank'll love it. Don't worry about it.\n\nOMAR\nThat's up to Frank -- not you.\n\nHe looks embarrassed at Sosa who has been watching, sensing\n-- also an advantage in the split.\n\nOMAR\nI'm sorry about this, Mr. Sosa...\n\nSOSA\nIt's all right. Maybe your partner's right. Maybe you should talk to\nFrank.\n\nOMAR\n(a beat)\nOkay. I don't think this is something I want to do on an overseas phone, but I can go back to Miami and talk to Frank personally.\n\nSOSA\n(without hesitation)\nGood. My chopper can take you to Santa Cruz now. I have a jet there that'll have you in Miami in five hours.\nYou can be back here tomorrow. For lunch.\n\nOmar is taken aback by the speed of the plan.\n\nOMAR\nYeah. I guess so....\n\nTONY\nGreat.\n\nSOSA\n(glancing at Tony, to Omar)\n...leave your friend here. While you're gone maybe he can tell me how to run my business.\n\nOMAR\n(doesn't get it)\nI don't think that...\n\nTONY\n(lighting a cigar)\nHey, it's okay. You tell Frank I'm keeping this guy on ice for him...\n\nSosa laughs. Omar scowls.\n\nCUT TO\n\n95 EXT. SOSA VILLA - DAY 95\n\nThe helicopter blades whirr. The Skull waits inside with the Shadow. They both stare at:\nOmar, who, with one hesitant look, steps inside.\n\nThe chopper lifts off the lawn, the camera moving to the\npolo players exercising in the distance... a woman on a\nhorse rides by and we swing with her towards the villa.\n\nSosa walks Tony down an outside gallery towards the veranda where servants lay out the coffee and fruits.\n\nTONY\nYou know why they say Cubans are all screwed up?\n\nSOSA\nWhy?\n\nTONY\nCause the island's in the Caribbean, the government's in Russia, the Army's in Angola, and the people live in Miami.\n\nSosa laughs. They reach the veranda, Tony glancing past Sosa to an exotic-looking, dark-eyed senorita who gets off her horse, held by a servant, and joins them.\n\nTONY\n(overlapping the joke)\nThey got a beard there that's all. With a cigar and a big mouth.\n\nSOSA\nMaybe he'll move to Miami too...\nGabriella, my rose -- how was the ride?\n\nSosa changes his personality completely with her, dewy-eyed and loving. They peck each other's cheek lightly.\n\nGABRIELLA\n(distracted)\nLovely... but the sheep in the north pasture, they're destroying the grass, it's turning yellow. You must move them darling.\n\nSOSA\nI'll take care of it myself.\n\nGABRIELLA\n(turning to him)\n...and don't forget we have the Rinaldi's at eight.\n\nSOSA\nOf course not. Uh -- an associate of mine. From Miami. Tony Montana...\n(to Tony)\nMy fiance, Gabriella Montini.\n\nTONY\nHello....\nShe nods to him in that somewhat uninterested, rude, upperclass Latin way.\n\nGABRIELLA\nIt's a pleasure.\n\nShe withdraws. Tony watches her go.\n\nTONY\nI gotta hand it to you. You got everything a man could want.\n\nSosa, pleased, reaches for an expensive set of binoculars on the patio table, looks up through them, at the helicopter rising off the lawn.\n\nSOSA\n(focusing the binoculars)\nI like you Tony. There's no lying in you... Unfortunately I don't feel\nthe same way about the rest of your organization.\n\nTony glances up at the chopper, the servant pouring coffee for him.\n\nTONY\nIn-- l -- Whaddaya getting at, Mr. Sosa?\n\nSOSA\nI mean Omar Suarez.\n\nTony, puzzled, glances up at the chopper which now hovers there high above the estate.\n\nSosa passes him the binoculars.\n\nSOSA\nThis garbage was recognized by my associate at lunch.\nFrom several years ago, in New York. He was an informer for the police....\n\nTony, astonished, looks up.\n\n96 THROUGH THE BINOCULARS - OMAR 96\nterrified, being positioned at the door of the chopper by\nthe Shadow and the Skull, his hands tied to his back and a\nlength of thick rope looped around his neck. He is struggling backwards in vain.\n\nSOSA\nHe put Vito Duval and the Ramos Brothers -- Nello and Gino -- away for life. My associate used to work up there.\n\nThrough the binoculars -- they throw Omar out of the\nchopper and he flies downwards and jerks back up as the rope stretches taut, snapping his neck. He hangs there like a broken doll on a string as the chopper moves out of sight.\nA silence.\n\n\n97 TONY 97\nshaken, lowers the binoculars.\nSosa watches him closely for his reaction.\nTony looks back at him, contemplative.\nSosa goes over, pours himself some coffee.\n\nSOSA\nSo how do I know you're not a 'chivato' too Tony?\n\nTONY\n(awry, stalks up to him)\nHey Sosa -- get this straight right now ! I never fucked anybody over in my life didn't have it comin' to him okay! All I got's my two balls-- and my word -- and I don't break 'em. For nobody.\nThat piece of shit up there I never liked, I never trusted..\nFor all I know he's the guy who set me up and got my buddy Angel Fernandez killed.\nBut that's history. I'm here. He's not. You wanna go on with me, say it. You don't, make your move, hodedor!\n\nSOSA\n(moves away)\nI think you speak from the heart Montana, but I say to myself this\nLopez -- your boss -- he has 'chivatos' like that working for him, his judgment stinks. So I think to myself, what other mistakes has this Lopez guy made, how can I trust his organization...hunh? You tell me Tony.\n\nTONY\nHey Frank's smart. Don't blame him for that animal. It's crazy business we're in, it can happen to anybody -- even you y'know. I'll talk to Frank myself. I'll fix this thing up right between you.\n(then)\nYou got my word on that.\n\nSosa approaches Tony, focusing an intense stare on him,\nmakes an elaborate gesture of putting his hands out, Tony\nfollowing the pantomime, puts his out. Sosa now grips them.\n\nSOSA\nYou speak with your eyes muchacho. I think -- you and I -- we can work this thing out, do business a long time together. Just remember -- it's the only thing I ever tell you -- don't fuck me Tony, don't ever try to fuck me.\n\nTheir eyes locked together.\n\nCUT TO\nAERIAL VIEW - MIAMI - TWILIGHT 98\nIn all its Caribbean splendor with the long curving beach\nand rich white buildings, bathed in a lovely violet light.\nMusic theme continuing over.\n\nREVERSE WIPE TO\n\n99 EXT. LOPEZ MOTORS AUTO DEALERSHIP - LITTLE HAVANA - DAY 99\nIn long shot we see an agitated Lopez entering his dealership with his bodyguard. Against a background of used American cars without great distinction, he ad-libs his way through some customers and salesmen, shaking hands and acting like everybody's favorite uncle... 'till we see him approach Tony, who is waiting for him with Manny\noutside his office.\nHe jerks his head. Inside. They go.\n\nCUT TO\n100 INT. AUTO LOPEZ OFFICE - DAY 100\nThe office is highly decorated with plagues, mementos,\nCuban patriot flags, and lots of photographs, centering on\nJFK and RFK shaking the hand of Lopez who now stares\nincredulously at Tony.\n\nLOPEZ\n(livid)\nYou what!

He's gonna send hit squads up here that's what. There's gonna be war in the streets.\n\nTONY\nFrank... Frank...\n\nLOPEZ\n(ranting)\nYou know what this fucking trial is costing me in legal fees, Montana?\n...You expect me to believe Omar was a stoolie.\nCause Sosa said so? And' you bought that line?\n(pause, eyeing Tony)\nMaybe I made a mistake sending you down there? Maybe you and Sosa know something I don't know?\n\nTONY\nYou saying I'm not being straight with you Frank?\n\nLopez's bodyguard shifts. Manny slips his hand closer to his belt.\n\nLOPEZ\n(carefully)\nLet's just say I want things to stay the way they are. For now. Stall\nyour deal with Sosa.\n\nLong pause. Tony's eyes meeting Lopez's. He gave Sosa his word.\n\nTONY\n(finally)\n...have it your way boss.\n\nHe turns to leave, nods to Manny.\n\nLOPEZ\nMontana... just remember I am the boss.\n\nTONY\nSure you're the boss.\n\nGets to the door, Manny joining him.\n\nLOPEZ\nY'know I told you when you started Tony, the guys who last in this business are guys who fly straight, real low key, real quiet.. -the guys who want it all, the chicks and the champagne and the flash -- they don't last.\n\nTony saying nothing, goes out the door with Manny.\n\n101 EXT.

He doesn't get up from\nhis desk. His hair is flaming red. We saw him before, at the\nMutiny Club.\n\nSHEFFIELD\nWhat can I do for you Montana?\n\nTONY\n(indicates Manny)\nMy partner. Manny Ray.\n\nManny, standing in the background, nods...

I like the weather here just fine.\n\nHe stops, his eyes darting to pick out Gina laughing as she\nfollows burgundy suit out of the main room and down the\nstairs to the toilets.\nWithout hesitation, his irritation peaking now, Tony darts\nafter her.\n\nMANNY\nHey, where you going?\n\nHe doesn't answer.\n\nCUT TO\n108 INT. BABYLON CLUB - STAIRS AND LADIES ROOM - NIGHT 10E\nTony comes down the plush velvet stairs, flings himself\ninto the Ladies room...the ladies, surprised, look back at\nhim. No Gina.\n\n109 INT. BABYLON CLUB - MEN'S ROOM AND STAIRS - NIGHT 109\nHe moves over to the Men's room, throws the door open.\nThere are four legs visible in one of the stalls.\nTony moves past two men washing up, and hurls himself against\nthe door. It crashes open on Gina in the act of snorting coke, with\nburgundy suit running his hand along her ass.\n\nGINA\n(shocked)\nTony!\n\nTONY\nWhat are you doing! What are you doing!\n\nHe grabs burgundy suit by the collar and whips him several\ntimes into the wall.\n\nGINA\n(trying to restrain him)\nTony! What're you doing!

Several more people are watching.\n\nGINA\nYou got a nerve, Tony, you got a nerve! You can't tell me what to do. I'll do what I want to do. I'll go out with who I want and if I want to fuck them then I'll fuck them!\n\nTony, raging, smacks her the face. She reels back across into the toilet.\nTony stands there, abated.\n\nThe crowd is silent.\n\nManny moves across the floor and kneels down, consoles Gina who is sobbing.\n\nMANNY\n(tender)\nCome on, baby, it's okay... it's okay, he didn't mean it.\n(strokes her face)\n\nTONY\n(disturbed, to Manny)\nGet her home, get her outta here!\n\nHe turns and bulldozes his way through the growing crowd,\nno regrets, but disturbed.\n\nManny helps Gina to her feet.\n\nMANNY\nCome on, pussycat, I'll buy you a\ncup of coffee.\n\nCUT TO\n110 INT.

He\nfeels he raised you.\n\nGINA\nHe still thinks I'm fifteen. He's been in jail five years and he still thinks I'm fifteen!\n\nMANNY\nHey, you're the best thing he's got. The only thing. He don't want you to grow up to be like him. So he's got this father thing for you, protect you...\n\nGINA\nAgainst what?\n\nMANNY\n'Gainst assholes -- like the sleazeball in the red suit.\n\nHe says it like it's personal.\n\nGINA\n(picks up on it)\nI like Fernando, he's a nice guy, he knows how to treat a woman.\n\nMANNY\n(a face)\nWhat future's he got?

Cause you don't know what you're missing....\n\nShe leans across the front seat and lightly lays a challenging kiss on his cheek. The ladykiller is rigid in his terror.\n\nShe gets out of the car, crosses in front of his headlights, towards the house, looking at him. He watches.\n\nCUT BACK TO\n113 INT. BABYLON CLUB - LATER THAT NIGHT 113\nThe Owner appears at the mike, the music drifting to Sinatra's \"Strangers In The Night'.\n\nOWNER\nAll right, you coneheads, another exciting evening at the Babylon, hunh?\nNow I want you to check out this next hombre. I found him stoned in the jungle and there's nothing you'll ever see like him. I present with great pride, from Caracas, Venezuela -- 'Octavia' !\n\nLights dimming to the bluesy rhythm of the Sinatra song as\nsad-eyed Octavia suddenly appears in the shifting spot-\nlight drawing immediate laughter.\n\nHe is dressed as an enormously fat old man with a Quasimodo\nmask covering both the front and back of his head and neck.\nWith a red bulb for a nose, he gyrates grotesquely to the sleek song; once the mood of laughter has been established, the music suddenly shifts upbeat to \"Saturday Night Fever\" and the clown, like a butterfly from a worm, starts shedding the stuffing from his clothes, his big eyes staring out at us in theatrical melancholy.\n\nTony watches, sitting alone, distracted by the clown.\nMore laughter, more clothes coming off, building a tempo.\nWhen the head mask comes off, we see the gaunt handsome\nface of a young clown in white paint with the large\nblackened eyes staring without expression at the laughing\naudience.\n\nTony is hooked by the image, looks on.\nThe clown is down to his leotards, thin as a stick, and\npulling the girls out onto the floor to dance with him,\nbouncing around like yo-yos. Everybody is laughing, everybody is merry...\n\n...except Tony and the clown, weaving in and out of the\nsharpening spotlight in his white face as the act comes to\nits close, a haunting figure of mockery....\n\nTony, absorbed by his thoughts, is lucky this time. His\nantennae warn him. Out of the side of his eye, he sees....\n\nThe two hitters moving on him.\nHe sprawls. Machine gun fire rips through the upholstery,\nsmashing the mirrors...\nScreams, crowd diving for cover...\n\nTony, hit in the shoulder, rolls, gets his Beretta out of\nhis ankle, firing...\nHits one of the gunmen in the chest; the man staggers across the disco floor firing volleys into the mirrors and ceilings...\n\nTony moving under the tables, towards the door, firing...\nThe second hitter is pinned, firing back, breaking more\nmirrors, and more screaming.\n\nTony lets the gunman have another burst then runs out the\ndoor, his clothes ripped with blood and glass.\n\nThe clown, Octavia, lies dead on the silent dance floor.\n\nCUT TO\n114 EXT. THE BABYLON CLUB - NIGHT 114\nTony runs out, crouched, to his red Jaguar.\n\nExchanging shots with a third hitter across the parking lot, he runs out of ammunition.\nHe jumps into the Jaguar, his windows being blown out.\n\nThe second hitter, wounded, running out of the club towards him.\nThe third hitter advancing, carhops scattering.\n\nTony reaching under his seat, gets a hold of his own Ingram machine pistol, cocks it and lays down a field of fire.\n\nCarhops scattering, the hitters seeking cover.\nHitter two, already wounded, is hit again, his head exploding like squashed watermelon.\n\nTony now pops a button. Bulletproof blackout shutters whap\nacross the shattered windows.\nHe guns the Jaguar out into the lot, bullets careening off\nthe armor plating, whining against the shutters.\n\nTony suddenly brakes the car and reaches down and slams the\ngear shift into reverse. In an instant, his warmobile in reverse, accelerates, climbing to top speed...\nAs hitter three realizes it's too late, tries to get out of\nthere, but is overtaken and crushed by the car.\n\nCUT TO\n\n115 INT. SAFEHOUSE - THAT NIGHT 115\nTony, aching from his wound, is attended by a Doctor, who\nreveals to us an ugly wound on his rib cage.

LOPEZ MOTORS - NIGHT 122\nWaldo remains outside, covering the street as Tony, Manny\nand Chi-chi move gingerly along the darkened showroom...\nLopez's voice on the phone through the half-opened office door.\n\nLOPEZ'S VOICE\n...you're kidding!

We're going to Sarasota for the State Championship... Hunh!\n\nMUFFLED VOICE\nCongratulations.

What'd you do -- fix the umpire?\n\nLopez, his nose in a glass of scotch, almost muffs it right\nthere and then, but manages to recover.\n\nLOPEZ\nTony...? Uh, I'll call you back -- yeah.\n\nHangs the phone up and rocks forward at his desk.\nLopez's bodyguard, Ernie, gets the message from Chi-chi\nsliding along the wall next to him, Manny covering the\nother side of the room.\n\nLOPEZ\nTony... what happened to you, hunh?\n\nTONY\nYeah, lookit. They spoiled one of\nmy $800 suits.\n\nLOPEZ\nJesus! Who?\n\nin his ripped suit, shoulder in a sling, face cut, Tony, shifts his eyes with camera slowly onto Mel Bernstein sitting there with a bourbon on the rocks, his two hundred and fifty pounds bulging with irritated surprise.\n\nTONY\nHitters. Somebody musta brought 'em.\nNever seen 'em before...Hiya\nii:;. Is there an answer to this too?\n\nBERNSTEIN\n(uneasy)\nAlways is Montana, always is...\n\nLOPEZ\nJesus, Tony, maybe it was the Diaz Brothers, they got a deep beef going back to the 'Sun Ray' thing.\n\nTONY\nHey, you might be right.\n\nLOPEZ\nAnyway I'm glad you made it Tony, we'll return the favor for you. In spades.\n\nTONY\n(sits at the edge of Lopez's desk)\nNah, I'm gonna take care of this myself.\n\nPause.\n\nLOPEZ\n(awkward)\nWell... What are the guns for Tony?\n\nTONY\n(shrugs)\nWhat for? I'm paranoid I guess.\n\nThe phone rings.\nLopez lets the phone ring.\n\nTONY\nWhy don't you answer it Frank?\n\nLOPEZ\nMust be Elvira. You know women.\nAfter we left that joint she....\n\nThe phone rings again.\n\nTONY\n(reaches for it)\nI'll tell her you're not here.\n\nLOPEZ\n(grabs the phone first)\nWait a minute! I'll talk to her... Hello?...\n(anxious)\nYeah... all right honey, don't worry... I'll be home in an hour.\n\nHe hangs up. Pause.\n\nTONY\nFrank, you're a piece of shit.\n\nLOPEZ\nWhatcha talking 'bout Tony?\n\nTony, angry now, grabs Lopez by the shirt and hauls him\nforward across his desk so his gut lies flat across it.\n\nTONY\nYou know what I'm talking about you fuckin' cockroach!\n\nLOPEZ\nTony, no! Lissen!\n\nTONY\nYou remember what a 'haza' is Frank?\nIt's a pig that don't fly straight. Neither do you, Frank.\n\nLOPEZ\n(nervous)\nWhy would I hurt you, Tony, I brought you in! So we had a few differences, no big deal. I gave you your start Tony, I believed in you !\n\nTONY\nYeah and I stayed loyal to you, Frank. I made what I could on the\nside but I never turned you Frank, never -- but you -- a man ain't got no word, he's a cockroach!\n\nHe squashes an imaginary cockroach right in front of Frank's eyes, then pulls him further across the desk, flailing.\n\nLOPEZ\nMel! Mel! Do something, please!\n\nMel sits there impassively.\n\nMEL\nIt's your tree Frank, you're sitting in it.\n\nLOPEZ\nPlease Tony okay all right! Gimme a second chance! Ten million.

I never hurt nobody!\n\nTONY\nYeah you're right Frank, you always had somebody else do it for you.\n\nHe turns to Manny.\n\nTONY\nManny, you mind shooting this piece of shit for me?\n\nTony steps aside.\n\nLOPEZ\nNo! No! Tony!\n\nManny shoots him with the silencer. Three times.\nLopez crashes backwards, draped over his desk like Marat in\nhis bathtub, amid his patriot flag and his Kennedy photographs.\n\nTONY\n...Every dog has his day.\n\nHe fixes his eyes on Mel Bernstein.\n\nBERNSTEIN\n(remaining calmly in his chair)\nI told him it didn't make sense -- killing you when he coulda had you working for us instead. But he got hot tonight, y'know, about the broad. He fucked up.\n\nTONY\nYeah, so did you, Bernstein.\n\nHis eyes... Bernstein, reading them, gets worried.\n\nBERNSTEIN\nNow wait a minute, Montana, don't go too far.\n\nTONY\nI'm not Mel. You are.\n\nHe produces his Beretta from his sling and holds it in his\nleft hand pointed at the big man.\n\nBERNSTEIN\n(rising from his chair)\nHey, c'mon, what is this?\nYou can't shoot a cop, Tony.\n\nTONY\nWhoever said you were one?\n\nHe fires.\n\nBernstein takes it in the gut, hits the floor, looks up astonished.\n\nBERNSTEIN\nI... lemme go, Tony, I can fix things up...\n\nTONY\nSure you can Chico. Maybe you can handle one of them first-class tickets -- to the Resurrection. So long, Mel, have a good trip.\n\nHe fires several times into him until we can imagine he is\nno longer of the living. Tony turns towards the door.\n\nMANNY\n(indicates bodyguard)\nWhat about him?\n\nTony notices.\nThe bodyguard, Ernie, the middle-aged Cuban, waits stoically.\n\nTONY\nYou want a job Ernie?\n\nERNIE\nSure, Tony.\n\nTONY\nCome see me tomorrow.\n\nERNIE\nThanks, Tony.\n\nTony walks out alone into the darkened showroom, past the\nhulks of the used Cadillacs, as we see the shadows of Manny\nand Chi-Chi moving in a stream of light.\n\nMANNY\n(Offscreen)\nOkay, torch it!\n\nCUT TO\n124 INT.

How's married life? Say hello to the princess for me -- okay. She's beautiful.\nSee you. Take care.\n\nGoing.\n\nTony watches, raging inside.

In the past two years, another 6,000 have simply disappeared. And your government -- what does it do? It\nsells my government tanks, planes, guns, but not a word -- not-a whisper-- about human rights!\n\nINTERVIEWER\nI've heard whispers, Doctor Gutierrez, about the financial support your government receives from the drug industry in Bolivia.\n\nGUTIERREZ\nThe irony, of course, is that this money -- which is in the billions,\nJim - - is coming from your country. You are the major purchaser of our national product -- which of course is cocaine.\n\nINTERVIEWER\nSo what you're saying Doctor Gutierrez is the United States Government is spending millions of dollars to eliminate the flow of drugs into our streets and at the same time is doing business with the very same government that floods those' streets with cocaine... that's a bit like robbing Peter to pay Paul, isn't it?\n\nGUTIERREZ\n(laughs)\nLet me show you some of the other characters in the comedy, Jim... my organization just recently traced a purchase by this man --\n\nGutierrez holds up a photograph -- insert the face on the TV\nscreen, dour, ruthless.\n\nGUTIERREZ\n. . . here he is, the charming face belongs to General Cucombre, the Defense Minister of my country.

Not your ordinary drug dealer....\n\nINTERVIEWER\nWhat are you suggesting we do about this, Doctor?\n\nGUTIERREZ\n(passionate)\nThe United States Government has to stop supporting these fascist gangsters that are running my country, that is what your country has to do. You have to set a strong example by calling for the observation of fundamental human rights.\n\n171 TONY 171\nstaring intently at him, reluctantly impressed.\n\nGUTIERREZ\nYou Americans have no idea how important your country is as a\nsymbol and a bastion of those rights. You have no....\n\nSosa flips off the television. The lights come on. He's alone with Tony.\n\nSOSA\n...he's scheduled next for 60 Minutes. He's going on French, British, Italian, Japanese television. People everywhere are starting to listen to him.

Is that what it's all about, Manny?\nEating, drinking, snorting, fucking? Then what?\nYou're fifty and you got a bag for a belly and tits with hair on 'em and your liver's got spots and you're looking like these rich fuckin' mummies in here?\nIs that what it's all about?\n\nMANNY\nIt's not so bad Tony, could be worse....\n\nTONY\n(doesn't hear)\n. . . is that what I worked 'for?

She gets up and dumps\nher plate filled with food on him. Slop drips all over him.\n\nELVIRA\nYou sonufabitch! You fuck!\n\nThey got a black tie audience now. The waiter tipping\naround to clean up the mess. Tony slowly wiping the food\noff himself.\n\nELVIRA\nHow dare you talk to me like that!\nYou call yourself a man! What makes you so much better than me, what do you do? Deal drugs? Kill people?\nOh that's just wonderful Tony -- a real contribution to human history. You want a kid. What kind of father do you think you'd make, Tony? What kind of stories are you going to tell the kid before he goes to sleep at night? You going to drive him to school in the mornings, Tony? You really think you're still going to be alive by the time he goes to school, Tony? You're dreaming, Tony, you're dreaming!\n\nThe audience is hushed, involved, the camera moving over\nthe faces of Vie and his rich friends.\n\nTony acidly quiet, looks around at the people, back to her.\n\nTONY\nSit down before I kill you.\n\nELVIRA\n. . . You think of yourself as a husband, too, Tony. But did you ever stay home without having six of your goons\naround all the time? I have Nick the Pig as a friend? What kind of life is that Tony? What kind of life is that?\n(in a softer tone)\nOh Tony don't you see? Don't you see what we've become? We're losers, honey, we're not winners, we're losers...\n\nSilence. Tony's fury has passed. So has Elvira's. There's\nthis awkwardness all of a sudden like two actors who forgot\ntheir lines.\n\nTONY\n(softly)\nGo on, get a cab home, you're stoned.\n(to Manny)\nManny.\n\nELVIRA\nNo, I'm not stoned Tony.

She starts wobbling out.\nPast the silent spectators, their eyes moving between her and Tony. Manny rises to follow.\n\nTONY\nLet her go! ...Another Quaalude and she'll love me again.\n\nStumbling once, Elvira disappears out the door.\nTony's eyes follow her. Pause.\n\nThe whole room is watching him sitting there covered with\nfood, the silence cathedral. He stands, wiping at the food\nand throwing several hundred dollar bills on the table,\nthen looks up angrily at the staring millionaires.\n\nTONY\nYou're all assholes. You know why?\nCause none of you got the guts to be what you want to be.\n\nHe wobbles against the table. Manny tries to help. Tony\nshakes him loose.\n\nTONY\nYou need people like me so you can point your fingers and say 'hey there's the bad guy!' So what does that make you? Good guys? Don't kid yourselves. You're no better'n me. You just know how to hide -- and how to lie. Me, I don't have that problem. I always tell the truth -- even when I lie.\n\nHe starts out, staggers.\n\nTONY\nSo say good night to the bad guy...\nYou're never gonna see a bad guy like me again.\n\nHe walks out, proud, Manny bringing up the rear. The room\nis empty for a beat -- an extended beat, the stage without\nits star -- and then the audience begins to buzz with horror\nand delight.\n\nCUT TO\n174 EXT.

With subtly inexorable music, the\ncamera frames and moves on the bomb -- wired, soldered,\ntaped -- a malignant centipede in the long agile fingers of\nthe Shadow, who delicately presses a tester. A glass button on the bomb now flashes red at soothing intervals as the Shadow winds a roll of black tape from the bomb to an\naxle of the car.\n\n177 ERNIE\nsignals.\n\n178 TONY\nsees it.\n\nA cop car comes cruising off the avenue up the street,\ntowards us.\n\nGround level -- the Shadow continues to wind his black tape trying to secure the bomb as tight as possible.\nTony hurries to the car, bends down.\n\nTONY\n(Spanish)\nPsst!

Like Papi -- like the way you made Papi feel. I made something outta my life. I'm somebody and I'm proud of it.\n\nMAMA\n(interrupts)\nSomebody? You're proud? You're a\n(Escoria!)\nnothing. You're an animal!\n\nTony storms out of the door as Mama pursues.\n\nMAMA\nGod help me, what have I done to you?\nYou were a beautiful baby. I used to watch you sleep. So beautiful. How? How, Dies Santo, did you become such a monster, such an ugly little monster....\n\nTony slams the door, we hold a beat on her face -- as if she had finally answered her own questions.\n\n218 EXT. MOTHER'S HOUSE 218\nTony stomps into his white Corniche, Ernie discreetly\nclosing the door and getting in with Chi-Chi as Mama rips\nopen her door in b.g. and stands there staring from the\ndoorway -- weeping and staring across the dark. Tony\ntakes a strong hit of coke. The car whistles off.\nCUT TO\n\n219 EXT. HOUSE - COCONUT GROVE - THAT NIGHT 219\nTony in the backseat of the Corniche with Chi-Chi studies\nthe house from across the curb. It's quiet, rich, suburban,\nnot calling attention to itself.\n\nTony, seething, snorts another line of coke laid out on the\ncrystal bar dividing the backseat, and rewed, goes.\n\nTONY\n(to Chi-Chi)\nWait here.\n\nHe approaches the front door, listening, the hand sliding into his pocket. Inside a wistful Billy Joel song plays over the stereo. He rings a buzzer, waits.\nHold the pause. The door opens casually. Standing there is Manny -- with a towel around his waist.\n\nMANNY\n(surprised)\nTony?\n\nTony stares, stunned.\nGina now comes into view behind Manny -- in a bathrobe, a\nbig smile of welcome for her brother.\n\nGINA\nTony!\n(eyes suddenly moving downward in alarm)\n\nTony with his Beretta pointed at Manny, his expression filled with loathing.\n\nManny smiles easily and shrugs, the gesture drawing Tony over the edge.\n\nMANNY\nHey Tony, c'mon we was....\n\nThe gun fires.\n\nGINA\nTony! No!\n\nTony fires a second time.\nManny slowly slumps downward against the doorjamb, eyes on Tony, terribly surprised.\n\nTony holds the gun, staring down, separated from himself.\nManny lies at his feet, dead.\n\nGINA\nManny!\n\nShe goes down to her knees, stunned out of her mind, shakes him.\n\nGINA\nManny!\n\nShe looks up, insanely, at Tony, her eyes huge with disbelief.\n\nGINA\nYou killed him?\n\nShaking her head at him incredulously.\n\nGINA\nWe got married just yesterday. We were gonna surprise you.\n\nTony stands there, doubly stunned by the news.\n\nGINA\nManolo, oh Manolo, what'd he do?\nWhat'd he do?\n\nShe hugs his corpse tightly to her breast and makes\nhorrible strangled sounds with her throat.\n\nChi-Chi hurrying up to Tony, worried somebody's seen the shooting. Ernie follows.\n\nCHI-CHI\nTony, come on. We gotta get out of here\n(to Gina)\nCome on baby...Gina!\n\nSuddenly she goes berserk.\n\nGINA\nNoooooooooooo!\n\nAnd shoving Chi-Chi aside, launches herself on Tony, screaming incoherently like a madwoman, trying to kill him. She beats him around the head, the chest, scratches furrows of flesh from his face. He stands there, oblivious, numbed.\n\nChi-Chi and Ernie have a demon on their hands. They manage at last to yank her off Tony, kicking and continuing to scream.\n\n220 EXT. MANNY'S HOUSE - NIGHT 220\nLights coming on in the houses around the neighborhood.\n\nChi-Chi and Ernie, desperate now, drag her forcefully along\nthe pavement into the Corniche. She continues to scream.\n\nERNIE\n(to Chi-Chi)\nGet the body!\n\nTony, back at the door, looks down again.\nThe eyes of Manolo staring sightlessly.\n\nChi-Chi runs back, grabs Tony.\n\nCHI-CHI\nTony!\n\nPulls him. Tony snaps out of it.\n\nTONY\nYeah!\n\nHe goes. Chi-Chi lifting Manny's body, hauling it.\nTony getting into the Corniche, Ernie pinning Gina against the front seat. Chi-Chi propping Manny into the driver's seat with him. The car roars away.\n\nThe camera closing on Gina as she looks through the glass partition of the Corniche, at the slumped head of Manny in foreground, the music surging inexorably.\n\nGINA\nManny! ...Manny! No!\n\nCUT TO -\n221 MIAMI STREETS - NIGHT 221\nThe white Corniche whistles by like a hearse heading for hell.\n\n222 EXT. TONY'S MANSION GROUNDS - THAT NIGHT 222\nIt goes roaring by the front gate and up the driveway,\ngravel flying.\n\nThe camera curving to reveal two sedans inching up the\nshadowed street, towards us, their lights out. The cars stop.\nEight men emerge silently, blending into the shadows of the trees.\n\n223 INT. TONY'S MANSION - NIGHT 223\n\nTony, scratches across his face, strides through the front\ndoor into the marble foyer. Another Marielito is waiting\nfor them at the door.\n\nErnie and Chi-Chi are almost carrying Gina, who is numb with shock.\n\nCHI-CHI\nWhat do we do with her Tony?\n\nTONY\nDo what? Where? Put her upstairs.\nPut her in my bedroom.\n(to Gina)\nIt'll be all right, pussycat, you'll see everything'11 be okay, I'll take\ncare of you....\n\nShe looks up at him through her stupor and spits in his face. Chi-Chi and Ernie pull her away -- as Tony stares, upset but passive.\nThey trundle her up the stairs. Tony turns and walks away.\n\n224 INT. TONY'S OFFICE - NIGHT 224\nTony slumps on his couch. A haze of coke rises off the velvet like a snow scene painting on a Christmas card.\nOblivious to the dust, he cuts open a fresh plastic kilo bag of coke and spreads the entire pound out across the black marble coffee table.\n\nErnie and Chi-Chi come in.\n\nCHI-CHI\nWe got some pills into her, she's cooling down.\n\nTony pays no attention, Ernie and Chi-Chi noticing the pile of coke.\nFlashing his silver tooter, Tony snorts a truly giant amount in a large pendular swing of his elbow across the length of coffee table.\nPause as he lets it sink in.\n\nCHI-CHI\n(worried)\nBoss, what we gonna do now?\n\nTONY\nDo? We're gonna war that's what we gonna do.\nWe gonna eat Sosa for breakfast. We're gonna close that\nfucker down.\n\nErnie and Chi-Chi sharing a look.\n\nCHI-CHI\n(eyeing the coke)\nHey Tony, why don't you go easy on that stuff, hunh?\n\nTony looks up at him, focuses. The eyes are uncompromising.\nErnie, a little scared of him now, turns away. Chi-Chi follows.\n\nTony starts on another trek along the coffee table.\n\nCUT TO\n225 EXT. TONY'S MANSION GROUNDS - LATER THAT NIGHT 225\nThe Bengal tiger paces his spot, restless.\nA monsoon-like wind blows through the trees on the estate.\nThe monkeys listen quietly.\nThe flamingoes flutter.\n. . . Then there's a burst of loud music from the stereo speakers on the balcony -- a Billy Joel song, something smooth and easy about the high times and how fast they go...\n\n. . . and we see Tony, in long shot, throw open the terrace doors and stagger out onto the balcony, overlooking his estate.\n. . . On a closer angle, we track him to the edge of the\nbalustrade. He's done so much coke now he's practically\ncatatonic; staggering and muttering to himself.\n\nTONY\n(insensate)\n. . . Jesus fuckin' Christ whatsa matter with me, get a hold of y'self now these cocksuckers gonna run over you, let 'em try, I bury the cocksuckers....\n\nHis point of view -- panning his estate. The dark emptiness echoes back at him. The wind rustling the treetops.\nTony shaking his head at himself, he starts to cry!\n\nTONY\n...Ooooh fuck Manny, how the fuck did I do that? How the fuck! ...oh Manny, Manny ...you were there for me, you were the one, Manny, you understood, always understood...\nWell what the hell happened, hunh?\nWhat the hell happened to us?...\n\nIn far background. now, behind Tony, on the video monitors in his office we see:\n\nThe main gate and guard shack -- a Marielito crosses into view, checks the gate, turns. Suddenly two figures spring\nout at him. One of them garrotting the Marielito. He struggles.\n\nAnother monitor now reveals two more figures moving into\nthe interior of the guard shack. They knife the other Marielito.\n\nA third monitor carries another image of shadows moving\nthrough the trees on the estate.\n\nOn the balcony, Tony is oblivious to it all, spent, almost\nincoherent.\n\nTONY\n...I said to you, Manny, I said I never go crazy and you said, I would\nyou sonofabitch and you was right... those were the good days hunh, we was crazy back in those days, we'd do anything, you and me, we was on the way up, nobody nothing coulda stopped us cause we were the best hunh -- the fucking best...\n\nAs Tony turns and starts back through the terrace doors into his study, the camera glides around to a view of a hook flying up and catching the balustrade. A shadow starts climbing up as:\n\nTONY\n...we still are Manny, we still are-- see, I'm gonna wipe out all them fuckers out there, I'm gonna run the market, I'm gonna be King Cocaine you hear me, you buy, you buy from me -- Tony Montana. Covers of all the magazines. Fan mail. Television stars, movie stars, shooting stars -- he's a star....\n\n\n226 INT. TONY'S MANSION - OFFICE 226\nAs he crosses into his office, the camera moves to reveal Gina standing there half-dressed in the doorway, her eyes blazing with hatred.\nTony sees her.\nShe steps forward, offering her body almost naked to her\nbrother.\n\nGINA\nIs this what you want Tony?...\n\nTony shocked.\n\nGINA\nYou can't stand another man touching me. So you want me Tony, is that it? Well here I am.\n\nShe fires the Baretta we now see in her hand.\n\nThe bullet grazes Tony in the leg, snapping him from his catatonia as he goes reeling across the floor behind his desk. She fires again. Again.\n\nGINA\nI'm all yours Tony, I'm all yours now.\n\nBullets ripping into the desk. She advances, offering her sex, methodically shooting out the clip at rhythmic intervals.\n\nGINA\nCome and get me Tony. Before it's too late.\n\nHe spins across the run away from the desk, trying to put\ndistance between them. She sees him scurrying,. turns, an\nexpression like a demented angel.\n\nGINA\nCome on Tony, fuck me! Fuck me! Fuck me!\n\nAdvancing on him, firing. The furniture tearing up, the chair\nspilling, television sets and computer toys shattering, Tony\nsquirming away, hit again in the thigh, shocked, scrambling\nover to the terrace windows. Her next shot shatters the window and as Tony ducks again to the side, we see outside onto the terrace behind him:\n\nA young Columbian punk no more than twenty -- one of the\nhitters -- is crouched there, reacting to the broken window.\nHe doesn't hesitate, turning his machine gun on Gina.\n\nGina is torn to pieces by the firepower -- blown across the\nroom, spine severed and dead before she hits the floor.\n\nTony sees it, yells something, in the same instant swivels to knock the barrel of the machine gun aside.\nThe punk is taken by surprise, not having seen Tony, and Tony now runs him backwards across the balcony and hurls him over the balustrade.\n\nThe punk lands in one of the shallow pools on the grounds\nat the base of the balcony.\nTony, from above, grabs up the punk's machine gun and\nempties the whole clip into the figure thrashing in the pool below.\n\nErnie runs into view on the far side of the pool, spots Tony, yells up ---\n\nERNIE\nGet outta here!\nTony, they're everywhere!\n\nErnie suddenly wheels, hit in the face, by a burst of silencer bullets.\n\nWe catch a brief glimpse of Sosa's black aide, the Skull,\nmoving quickly along the wall of the house -- directly\nunderneath the balcony on which Tony stands.\n\nTony, tossing the empty machine gun aside, wildly runs back\ninto his office to get more guns, crosses to Gina corpse.\nIt takes him by surprise. He comes to a dead stop, kneels, looking questioningly in her face.\n\nTONY\n(gently)\nHey Gina come on, you still angry at me? I didn't mean to kill Manny, I was... I was.\n\nRunning his hands along her face, trying to rouse her, gently lifting her eyelids. Blood's running out of her mouth in rivers.\n\nTONY tx:\nCome on Gina, get off the floor.\nYou're all dirty now, you need a bath...\nMami's gonna be angry baby\n-- ooh is she gonna be mad at me!..\nCome on open your eyes my baby,\nopen your eyes.. -give me a smile.\n\nThere's been a steady pounding and calling now on the door of the office. Tony finally hears it, looks up, then over at the monitors.\nOne of them reveals Chi-Chi standing there outside the door\npounding it.\n\nCHI-CHI\nBoss ! Hey boss. Open up!\n\nOn the monitor we see Chi-Chi suddenly spin and open fire\ndown into the foyer. Return fire decimates him. A grenade\ngoes off, blows him up against the door.\n\nTONY\nCheeee!\n\nHe now seems to come out of his catatonia, runs to his\nsideboard, hauls out a rocket shoulder-fired rocket launcher and straps an Uzi across his shoulder. He looks up at the monitor.\n\nOn the monitors, the hitters are now darting across the\nfoyer and coming up the left and right hand stairs.\nThree of them are already huddled outside the door, around\nthe corpse of Chi-Chi, motioning to-each other, laying a grenade at the base of the door to blow it out.\n\nTony loading his rocket, intends to beat them to the punch,\ntalking to himself.\n\nTONY\nSo you wanna play hunh, say hello to my little friend here.\n\nKarroooomph!\nThe rocket tears down the door and blows the Columbian punks off the landing into the foyer.\nIt sounds like Armageddon, one of the hitters screaming, smoke billowing wildly.\n\nTony, at the height of his mad glory, steps out at the apex\nof the stairs, firing his machine gun and yelling.\n\nTONY\nWhores! Cowards! You think you can kill me with lousy bullets hunh?\n\nAnother hitter tumbles down the right-hand stair.\n\nTONY\nWho you think I am? I kill all you fuckin' assholes. I take you all to fuckin' hell!\n\nAnother hitter drops, screaming, off the stairs into the pool below.\nA grenade goes off. Tony is hit again, but keeps on firing\naway. Laughing like a madman.\n\nTONY\nYou need an army you hear! An army to kill me!\n\nBehind him we see the remainder of the pound of cocaine go\nup in a burst of wind, whipping around the office in auras of white. It is a ghostly effect out of which now appears the face of the Skull moving from the terrace towards Tony's back with a sawed-off shotgun.\n\nTONY\nHa ha ha ha ha! You whores, you scum, I piss in your faces!!!! Ha ha ha ha ha!!\n\nThe Skull, now inches from Tony's back, pulls the trigger and blows Tony's spine out his belly.\n\nTony crashes forward over the banister into the interior\nswimming pool below.\n\nHe floats quietly face down in the lit blue waters.\n\nAs the titles begin their crawl up, the music theme is\nexpressive salsa with a dash of gaiety.\n\nThe camera moving off Tony to catch the reflection of the lit sculpture on the surface of the still waters. It says:\n\"THE WORLD IS YOURS\"\nAnd so, for the brief moment, it was.\n\nOur camera now distancing itself from the body in the pool,\npanning past the dream villa, past the shambles and the\nwealth, past the hitters pillaging and looting and drawing\nthat obscene word \"Chivato\" in blood on the outside walls,\npast the stacks of cash blowing across the floor like leaves in autumn, with the looters running after it across the busted door with the tropic wind blowing down Coconut\nGrove -- to the Miami skyline across Biscayne Bay\n\nTHE ENDEmbed","language":"en"}
