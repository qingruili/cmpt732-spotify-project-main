{"track_id":"0247StOpd3AkeBQzANX4Zf","lyrics":"2 ContributorsSome Dreamers of the Golden Dream LyricsThis  is a story about love and death in the golden land, and begins with the country.  The San Bernardino Valley lies only an houreast of Los Angeles by way of the San Bernardino Freeway but is in certain ways an alien place:  not the coastal  the California ofsubtropical twilights and the soft westerlies off the Pacific but a harsher California, haunted by the Mohave just beyond the mountains, devastated by the hot dry Santa Ana wind that comes down through the passes at 100 miles an hour and whines through the Eucalypts windbreaks and works on the nerves.  October is the bad month for the wind, the month when breathing is difficult and the hills blaze up spontaneously. There has been no rain since April.  Every voice seems a scream.  It is the season of suicide and divorce and prickly dread, wherever the wind blows.\n\nThe Mormons settled this ominous country, and then they abandoned it but by the time they left the first orange tree had been planted and for the next hundred years the San Bernardino Valley would draw a kind of people who imagined they might live among the talismanic fruit and prosper in die dry air, people who brought with them Mid-western ways of building and cooking and praying and who tried to graft those ways upon the land.  The graft took incurious ways.  This is the California where it is possible to live and die without ever eating an artichoke, without ever meeting a Catholic or a Jew.  This is the California where it is easy to Dial-A-Devotion, but hard to buy a book.  This is the country in which a belief in the literal interpretation of Genesis has slipped imperceptibly into a belief in the literal interpretation of Double Indemnity, the country of the teased hair and the Capris and the girls for whom all life's promise comes down to a waltz-length white wedding dress and the birth of a Kimberly or a Sherry or a Debbi and a Tijuana divorce and return to hairdressers' school.  “We were just crazy kids” they say without regret, and look to the future.  The future always looks good in the golden land, because no one remembers the past.  Here is where the hot wind blows and the old ways do not seem relevant, where the divorce rate is double the national average and where one person in every thirty-eight lives in a trailer.\n\nHere is the last stop for all those who  come from somewhere else, for all those who drifted away from the cold and the past and the old ways.  Here is where they are trying to find a new life style, trying to find it in the only places they know to look:  the movies and the newspapers.  The case of Lucille Marie Maxwell Miller is a tabloid monument to that new life style.\n\nImagine Banyan Street first, because Banyan is where it happened. The way to Banyan is to drive west from San Bernardino out Foothill Boulevard, Route 66:  past the Santa Fe switching yards, the Forty Winks Motel.  Past the motel that is nineteen stucco tepees:  \"SLEEP IN A WIGWAM-GET MORE FOR YOUR WAMPUM.\"  Past Fontana Drag City and the Fontana Church of the Nazarene and the Pit Stop A Go-Go; past Kaiser Steel, through Cucamonga, out to the Kapu Kai Restaurant-Bar and Coffee Shop, at the corner of Route 66 and Carnelian Avenue.  Up Carnelian Avenue from the Kapu Kai, which means \"Forbidden Seas,\" the subdivision flags whip in the harsh wind.  \"HALF-ACRE RANCHES!  SNACK BARS! TRAVERTINE ENTRIES!  $95 DOWN.\"  It is the trail of an intention gone haywire, the flotsam of the New California.  But after awhile the signs thin out on Carnelian Avenue, and the houses are no longer the bright pastels of the Springtime Home owners but the faded bungalows of the people who grow a few grapes and keep a few chickens out here, and then the hill gets steeper and the road climbs and even the bungalows are few, and here desolate, roughly surfaced, lined with eucalyptus and lemon groves---is Banyan Street.\n\nLike so much of this country, Banyan suggests something curious and unnatural. The lemon groves are sunken, down a three- or four-foot retaining wall, so that one looks directly into their dense foliage, too lush, unsettlingly  glossy, the greenery of nightmare; the fallen eucalyptus bark is too dusty, a place for snakes to breed.  The stones look not like natural stones but like the rubble of some unmentioned upheaval.  There are smudge pots, and a closed cistern.  To one side of Banyan there the flat valley, and to the other the San Bernardino Mountains, a dark mass looming too high, too fist, nine, ten, eleven thousand feet, right there above the lemon groves.  At midnight on Banyan Street there is no light at all, and no sound except the wind in the eucalyptus and a muffled barking of dogs.  There may be a kennel somewhere, or the dogs may be coyotes.\n\nBanyan Street was the route Lucille Miller took home from the twenty-four hour Mayfair Market on the night of October 7, 1969, a night when the moon was dark and the wind was blowing and she was out of milk, and Banyan Street was where, at about 12:30 A.M., her 1964 Volkswagen came to a sudden stop, caught fire, and began to burn.  For an hour and fifteen minutes Lucille Miller ran up and down Banyan calling for help, but no cars passed and no help came.  At three o'clock that morning, when the fire had been put out and the California Highway Patrol officers were completing their report, Lucille Miller was still sobbing and incoherent, for her husband had been asleep in the Volkswagen.  \"What will I tell the children, when there's nothing left, nothing left in the casket:' she cried to the friend called to comfort her.  \"How can I tell them there's nothing left?\"\n\nIn fact there was something left, and a week later it lay in the Draper Mortuary Chapel in a closed bronze coffin blanketed with pink carnations.  Some 200 mourners heard Elder Robert E. Denton of the Seventh-Day Adventist Church of Ontario speak of \"the temper of fury that has broken out among us.\"  For Gordon Miller, he said, there would be \"no more death, no more heartache, and no more misunderstandings.\"  Elder Ansel Bristol mentioned the \"peculiar\" grief of the hour.  Elder Fred Jensen asked \"what shall it profit a man, if he shall gain the whole world, and lose his own soul?\"  A light rain fell, a blessing in a dry season, and a female vocalist sang \"Safe in the Arms of Jesus.\"  A tape recording of the service was made for the widow, who was being held without bail in the San Bernardino County jail on a charge of first-degree murder.\n\nOf course she came from somewhere else, came off the prairie, in search of something she had seen in a movie or heard on the radio.  For this is a Southern California story.  She was born on January 17, 1930, in Winnipeg, Manitoba, the only child of Gordon and Lily Maxwell, both school teachers hers and both dedicated to the  Seventh-Day Adventist Church whose members observe the Sabbath on Saturday, believe in an apocalyptic Second Coming, have a strong missionary tendency, and, if they are strict, do not smoke, drink, eat meat, use makeup, or wear jewelry, including wedding rings.  By the time Lucille Maxwell enrolled at Walla Walla College in College Place, Washington, the Adventist school where her parents then taught, she was an eighteen-year-old possessed of unremarkable good looks and remarkable high spirits.  \"Lucille wanted to see the world,\" her father would say in retrospect, \"and I guess she found out.\"\n\nThe high spirits did not seem to lend themselves to an extended course of study at Walla Walla College and in the spring of 1949 Licille-Maxwell met and married Gorgon (\"Cork\") Miller, a twenty-four-year-old graduate of Walla Walla and of the University of Oregon dental school, then stationed at Fort Lewis as a medical officer.  \"Maybe you could say it was love at first sight,\" Mr. Maxwell recalls.  \"Before they were ever formally introduced, he sent Lucille a dozen and a half roses with a card that said even if she didn't come out on a date with him, he hoped she'd find the roses pretty anyway.\" The Maxwells remember their daughter as a' \"radiant\" bride.\n\nUnhappy marriages so resemble one another that we do not need to know too much about the course of this one.  There may or may not have been trouble on Guam, where Cork and Lucille Miller lived while he finished his Army duty.  There may or may not have been problems in the small Oregon town where he first set up private practice.  There appears to have been some disappointment-about their move to California:  Cork Miller bad told friends that he wanted to become a doctor, that he was unhappy as a dentist and planned to enter the Seventh-Day Adventist College of Medical Evangelists at Loma Linda, a few miles south of San Bernardino. Instead he bought a dental practice in the west end of San Bernardino County, and the family settled there, In a modest house on the kind of street where there are always tricycles and revolving credit and dreams about bigger houses, better streets. That was 1957.  By the summer of 1964 they had achieved -the bigger house on the better street and the familiar accouterments of a family on its way up: the $30,000 a year, the three children for the Christmas card, the picture window, the family room, the newspaper photographs that showed \"Mrs. Gordon Miller, Ontario Heart Fund Chairman.\"  They were paying the familiar price for it.  And they had reached the familiar season of divorce.\n\nIt might have been anyone’s bad summer, anyone's siege of heat and nerves and migraine and money worries, but this one began particularly early and particularly badly.  On April 24 an old friend, Elaine Hayton, died suddenly; Lucille Miller had seen her only the night before.  During the month of May, Cork Miller was hospitalized briefly with a bleeding ulcer, and his usual reserve deepened into depression.  He told his accountant that he was \"sick of looking at open mouths” and threatened suicide.  By July 8, the conventional tensions of love and money had reached the conventional impasse in the new house on the acre lot at 8488 Bella Vista, and Lucille Miller filed for divorce.  Within a month, however, the Millers seemed reconciled.  They saw a marriage counselor.  They talked about a fourth child.  It seemed that the marriage had reached the traditional truce, the  point at which so many resign themselves to cutting both their losses and their hopes.\n\nBut the Millers' season of trouble was not to end that easily.  October 7 began as a commonplace enough day, one of those days that sets the teeth on edge with its tedium, its small frustrations.  The temperature reached 102 degrees in San Bernardino that afternoon, and the Miller children were home from school because of Teachers' Institute.  There was ironing to be dropped off.  There was a trip to pick up a prescription for Nembutal, a trip to a self-service dry cleaner.  In the early evening, an unpleasant accident with the Volkswagen:  Cork Miller hit and killed a German shepherd, and afterward said that his head felt “like it had a Mack truck on it.”  It was something he often said.  As of that evening Cork Miller was $630,479 in debt, including the $29,637 mortgage on the new house, a debt load which seemed oppressive to him.  He was a man who wore his responsibilities uneasily, and complained of migraine headaches almost constantly.\n\nHe ate alone that night, from a TV tray in the living room.  Later tile Millers watched John Forsythe and Santa Berger in See How They Run, and when the movie ended, about eleven, Cork Miller suggested that they go out for milk.  He wanted some hot chocolate.  He took a blanket and pillow from the couch and climbed into the passenger seat of the Volkswagen.  Lucille Miller remembers reaching over to lock his door as she backed down the driveway.\nBy the time she left tile Mayfair Market, and long before they reached Banyan Street, Cork Miller appeared to be asleep.  There is some confusion in Lucille Miller's mind about what happened between 12:30 A.M., when the fire broke out, and 1:50 A.M., when it was reported.  She says that she was driving east on Banyan Street at about 35 m.p.h. when she felt the Volkswagen pull sharply to the right.  The next thing she knew the car was on the embankment, quite near the edge of the retaining wall, and flames were shooting up behind her.  She does not remember jumping out.  She does remember prying up a stone with which she broke the window next to her husband, and then scrambling down the retaining wall to try to find a stick.  \"I don't know how I was going to push him out,\" she says. \"I just thought if I had a stick, I'd push him out.\"  She could not, and after a while she ran to the intersection of Banyan and Carnelian Avenue.  There are no houses at that corner, and almost no traffic.  After one car had passed without stopping, Lucille Miller ran back down Banyan toward tile burning Volkswagen.  She did not stop, but she slowed down, and in the flames she could see her husband.  He was, she said, \"just black.\"\n\nAt the first house up Sapphire Avenue, half a mile from the Volkswagen, Lucille Miller finally found help.  There Mrs. Robert Swenson called the sheriff, and then, at Lucille Miller's request, she called Harold Lance, the Millers' lawyer and their close friend.  When Harold Lance arrived he took Lucille Miller home to his wife, Joan.  Twice Harold Lance and Lucille Miller returned to Banyan Street and talked to the Highway Patrol officers.  A third time Harold Lance returned alone, and when he came back he said to Lucille Miller, \"O.K....you don't talk any more.\"\n\nWhen Lucille Miller was arrested the next afternoon, Sandy Slagle was with her.  Sandy Slagle was the intense, relentlessly loyal medical student who used to baby-sit for the Millers, and bad been living as a member of the family since she graduated from high school in 1959.  The Millers took her away from a difficult home situation, and she thinks of Lucille Miller not only as \"more or less a mother or a sister\" but as \"the most wonderful character\" she has ever known.  On the night of the accident, Sandy Slagle was in her dormitory at Loma Linda University, but Lucille Miller called her early in the morning and asked her to come home.  The doctor was there when Sandy Slagle arrived, giving Lucille Miller an injection of Nembutal.  \"She was crying as she was going under” Sandy Slagle recalls. \"Over and over she'd say,  'Sandy, all the hours I spent trying to save him and now what are they trying to do to me?’\"\n\nAt 1:30 that afternoon, Sergeant William Paterson and Detectives Charles Callahan and Joseph Karr of the Central Homicide Division arrived at 8488 Bella Vista.  \"One of them appeared at the bedroom door:  Sandy Slagle remembers \"and said to Lucille, 'You've got ten minutes to get dressed or we'll take you as you are.’ She was in her night gown, you know, so I tried to get her dressed.\"\n\nSandy Slagle tells the story now as if by rote and her eyes do no waver.  \"So I had her panties and bra on her and they opened the door again, so I got some Capris on her, you know, and a scarf.\"  Her voice drops.  \"And then they just took her.\"\n\nThe arrest took place just twelve hours after the first report that there had been an accident on Banyan Street, a rapidity which would later prompt Lucille Miller’s attorney to say that the entire case was an instance of trying to justify a reckless arrest.  Actually what first caused the detectives who arrived on Banyan Street toward dawn that morning to give the accident more than routine attention were certain apparent physical inconsistencies.  While Lucille Miller had said that she was driving about 35 m.p.h. when the car swerved to a stop, an examination of the cooling Volkswagen showed that it was in low gear, and that the parking rather than the driving lights were on.  The front wheels, moreover, did not seem to be in exactly the position that Lucille Miller's description of the accident would suggest, and the right rear wheel was dug in deep, as if it had been spun in place.  It seemed curious to the detectives, too, that a sudden stop from 35 m.p.h.—the same jolt which was presumed to have knocked over a gasoline can in the back seat and somehow started the fire—should have left two milk cartons up right on the back floorboard, and the remains of a Polaroid camera box lying apparently undisturbed on the back seat.\n\nNo one, however, could be expected to give a precise account of what did and did not happen in a moment of terror, and none of these inconsistencies seemed in themselves incontrovertible evidence of criminal intent.  But they did interest the Sheriffs Office, as did Gordon Miller's apparent unconsciousness at the time of the accident, and the length of time it had taken Lucille Miller to get help.  Something, moreover, struck the investigators as wrong about Harold Lance's attitude when he came back to Banyan Street the third time and found the investigation by no means over.  \"The way Lance was acting,\" the prosecuting attorney said later, \"they thought maybe they'd hit a nerve.\"\n\nAnd so it was that on the morning of October 8, even before the doctor had come to give Lucille Miller an injection to calm her, the San Bernardino County Sheriffs Office was trying to construct another version of what might have happened between 12:30 and 1: 50 A.M.  The hypothesis they would eventually present was based on the somewhat tortuous premise that Lucille Miller had undertaken a plan which failed: a plan to stop the car on the lonely road, spread gasoline over her presumably drugged husband, and, with a stick on the accelerator, gently \"walk\" the Volkswagen over the embankment, where it would tumble four feet down the retaining wall into the lemon grove and almost certainly explode.  If this happened, Lucille Miller might then have somehow negotiated the two miles up Carnelian to Bella Vista in time to be home when the accident was discovered.  This plan went awry, according to the Sheriff's Office hypothesis, when the car would not go over the rise of the embankment.  Lucille Miller might have panicked then—after she had killed the engine the third or fourth time, say, out there on the dark road with the gasoline already spread and the dogs baying and the wind blowing and the unspeakable apprehension that a pair of headlights would suddenly light up Banyan Street and expose her there—and set the fire herself.\n\nAlthough this version accounted for some of the physical evidence, the car in low because it had been started from a dead stop, the parking lights on because she could not do what needed doing without some light, a rear wheel spun in repeated attempts to get the car over the embankment, the milk cartons upright because there had been no sudden stop—it did not seem on its own any more or less credible than Lucille Miller's own story.  Moreover, some of the physical evidence did seem to support her story: a nail in a front tire, a nine-pound rock found in the car, presumably the one with which she had broken the window in an attempt to save her husband.  Within a few days an autopsy had established that Gordon Miller was alive when he burned, which did not particularly help the State's case, and that he had enough Nembutal and Sandoptal in his blood to put the average person to sleep, which did: on the other hand Gordon Miller habitually took both Nembutal and Fiorinal (a common headache prescription which contains Sandoptal), and had been ill besides.\n\nIt was a spotty case, and to make it work at all the State was going to have to find a motive.  These was talk of unhappiness, talk of another man.  That kind of motive, during the next few weeks, was what they set out to establish.   They set out to find it in accountants’ ledgers and double-indemnity clauses and motel registers, set out to determine what might move a woman who believed in all the promises of  the middle class—a woman who had been\n\nchairman of the Heart Fund and who always knew a reasonable little dressmaker—and who had come out of the bleak wild of prairie fundamentalism to find what she imagined to be the good life—what would drive such a woman to sit on  street called Bella Vista and look out her new picture window into the empty California sun and calculate how to burn her husband alive in a Volkswagen.   They found the wedge they wanted closer at hand than they might have at first expected, for, as testimony would reveal later at the trial, it seemed that in December of 1963 Lucille Miller had begun an affair with the husband of one of her friends, a man whose daughter called her \"Auntie Lucille,\" a man who might have seemed to have the gift for people and money and the good life that Cork Miller so noticeably lacked.  The man was Arthwell Hayton, a well-known San Bernardino attorney and at one time a member of the district attorney's staff.\n\nIn some ways it was the conventional clandestine affair in a place like San Bernardino, a place where little is bright or graceful, where it is routine to misplace the future and easy to start looking for it in bed.  Over the seven weeks that it would take to try Lucille Miller for murder, Assistant District Attorney Don A. Turner and defense Attorney Edward P. Foley would between them unfold a curiously predictable story.  There were the falsified motel registrations.  There were the lunch dates, the afternoon drives in Arthwell Hayton's red Cadillac convertible.  There were the interminable discussions of the wronged partners.  There were the confidantes (\"I knew everything,\" Sandy Slagle would insist fiercely later.  \"I knew every time, places, everything')  and there were the words remembered from bad magazine stories (\"Don't kiss me, it will trigger things,\" Lucille Miller remembered telling Arthwell Hayton in the parking lot of Harold's Club in Fontana after lunch one day) and there were the notes, the sweet exchanges: \"Hi Sweetie Pie!  You are my cup of teal!  Happy Birthday—you don't look a day over 29!!  Your baby, Arthwell.\"\n\nAnd, toward the end, there was the acrimony.  It was April 24, 1964, when Arthwell Hayton's wife, Elaine, died suddenly, and nothing good happened after that.  Arthwell Hayton had taken his cruiser, Captain’s Lady, over to Catalina that weekend; he called home at nine o'clock Friday night, but did not talk to his wife because Lucille Miller answered the telephone and said that Elaine was showering.  The next morning the Haytons' daughter found her mother in bed, dead.  The newspapers reported the death as accidental, perhaps the result of an allergy to hair spray.  When Arthwell Hayton flew home from Catalina that weekend, Lucille Miller met him at the airport, but the finish had already been written.\nIt was in the breakup that the affair ceased to be in the conventional mode and began to resemble instead the novels of James M. Cain, the movies of the late 30s, all the dreams in which violence and threats and blackmail are made to seem commonplaces of middle-class life.  What was most startling about the case the State of California was preparing against Lucille Miller was something that had nothing to do with law at all, something that never appeared in the eight-column afternoon headlines but was always there between them: the revelation that the dream was teaching the dreamers how to live.  Here is Lucille Miller talking to her lover sometime in the early summer of 1964, after, he had indicated that, on the advice of his minister, he did not intend to see her any more:  \"First, I'm going to go to that dear pastor of yours and tell him a few things.... When I do tell him that, you won't be in the Redlands Church any more... Look, Sonny Boy, if you think your reputation is going to be ruined, your life won't be worth two cents.\"  Here is Arthwell Hayton, to Lucille Miller: \"I'll go to Sheriff  Frank Bland and tell him some things that I know about you until you'll wish you'd never heard of Arthwell Hayton.'  For an affair between a Seventh-Day Adventist dentist's wife and a Seventh-Day Adventist personal-injury lawyer, it seems a curious kind of dialogue.\n\n\"Boy, I could get that little boy coming and going,\" Lucille Miller later confided to Erwin Sprengle, a Riverside contractor who was a business partner of Arthwell Hayton's and a friend to both the lovers.  (Friend or no, on this occasion he happened to have an induction coil attached to his telephone in order to tape Lucille Miller's call.)  \"And he hasn't got one thing on me that he can prove.  I mean, I've got concrete has nothing concrete.\"   In the same taped conversation with Erwin Sprengle, Lucille Miller mentioned a tape that she herself had surreptitiously made, months before, in Arthwell Hayton's car.\n\n\"I said to him, I said 'Arthwell, I just feel like I'm being used!  . . He started sucking his thumb and he said I love you. . . . This isn't something that happened yesterday.  I'd marry you tomorrow if I could.  I don't love Elaine.' He'd love to. hear that played back, wouldn't he?\"\n\n\"Yeah:' drawled Sprengle's voice on the tape.  \"That would be just a little incriminating, wouldn't it?\"\n\n\"Just a little incriminating,' Lucille Miller agreed.  \"It really is.\"\n\nLater on the tape, Sprengle asked where Cork Miller was.\n\n\"He took the children down to the church.\"\n\"You didn't go?\"\nNo.\"\n\"You're naughty.\"\n\nIt was all, moreover, in the name of “love”; everyone involved placed a magical faith in the efficacy of the very word.  There was the significance that Lucille Miller saw in Arthwell's saying that he \"loved\" her, that he did not \"love\" Elaine.  There was Arthwell insisting, later, at the trial, that he had never said it, that he may have \"whispered sweet nothings in her ear\" (as her defense hinted that he had whispered in many ears), but he did not remember bestowing upon her the special seal, saying the word, declaring \"love.\"   There was the summer evening when Lucille Miller and Sandy Slagle followed Arthwell Hayton down to his new boat in its mooring at Newport Beach and untied the lines with Arthwell aboard, Arthwell and a girl with whom he later testified he was drinking hot chocolate and watching television.  “I did that on purpose,” Lucille Miller told Erwin Sprengle later, \"to save myself from letting my heart do something crazy.\"\n\nJanuary 11, 1965, was a bright warm day in Southern California, the kind of day when Catalina floats on the Pacific horizon and the air smells of orange blossoms and it is a long way from the bleak and difficult East, a long way from the cold, a long way from the past.  A woman in Hollywood staged an all-night sit-in on the hood of her car to prevent repossession by a finance company.  A seventy-year-old pensioner drove his station wagon at five miles an hour past three Gardena poker parlors and emptied three pistols and a twelve-gauge shotgun through their windows, wounding twenty-nine people.  \"Many young women become prostitutes just to have enough money to play cards,\" he explained in a note.  Mrs. Nick Adams said that she was \"not surprised\" to hear her husband announce his divorce plans on the Les Crane Show, and, farther north, a sixteen-year-old jumped off the Golden Gate Bridge and lived.\n\nAnd, in the San Bernardino County Courthouse, the Miller trial opened.  The crowds were so bad that the glass courtroom doors were shattered in the crush, and from then on identification disks were issued to the first forty-three spectators in line.  The line began forming at 6 A.m., and college girls camped at the courthouse all night, with stores of graham crackers and No-Cal.\n\nAll they were doing was picking a jury, those first few days, but the sensational nature of the case had already suggested itself.  Early in December there had been an abortive first trial, a trial at which no evidence was ever presented because on the day the jury was seated the San Bernardino Sun-Telegram ran an \"inside\" story quoting Assistant District Attorney Don Turner, the prosecutor, as saying, \"We are looking into the circumstances of Mrs. Hayton's death.  In view of the current trial concerning the death of Dr. Miller, I do not feel I should comment on Mrs. Hayton's death.\"  It seemed that there had been barbiturates in Elaine Hayton's blood, and there had seemed some irregularity about the way she was dressed on that morning when she was found under the covers, dead. Any doubts about the death at the time, however, had never gotten as far as the Sheriff's Office.  \"I guess somebody didn't want to rock the boat,\" Turner said later.  “These were prominent, people.”\n\nAlthough all of that had not been in the Sun-Telegram’s story, an immediate mistrial had been declared.  Almost as immediately, there had been another development: Arthwell Hayton had asked newspapermen to an 11 A.M. Sunday morning press conference in his office.  There had been television cameras, and flash bulbs popping.  \"As you gentlemen may know,\" Hayton had said, striking a note of stiff bonhomie, \"there are very often women who become amorous toward their doctor or lawyer. This does not mean on the physician's or lawyer’s part that there is any romance toward the patient or client.\"\n\"Would you deny that you were having an affair with Mrs. Miller?\" a reporter had asked.\n\"I would deny that there was any romance on my part whatsoever.\"\nIt was a distinction he would maintain through all the wearing weeks to come.\n\nSo they had come to see Arthwell, these crowds who now milled beneath the dusty palm outside the courthouse, and they had also come to see Lucille, who appeared as a slight, intermittently pretty woman, already pale from lack of sun, a woman who would turn thirty-five before the trial was over and whose tendency toward haggardness was beginning to show. a meticulous woman who insisted against her lawyer's advice, on coming to court with her hair piled high and lacquered.  “I would've been happy if she'd come in with it hinging loose, but Lucille wouldn't do that,” her lawyer said.  He was Edward P. Foley, a small, emotional Irish Catholic who several times wept in the courtroom.  “She his a great honesty, this woman,” he added, “but this honesty about her appearance always worked against her.”\n\nBy the time the trial opened, Lucille Miller's appearance included maternity clothes, for an official examination on December 18 had revealed that she was then three and a half months pregnant, a fact which made picking a jury even more difficult than usual, for Turner was asking the death penalty.  \"It's unfortunate but there it is,\" he would say of the pregnancy to each juror in turn, and finally twelve were seated, seven of them women, the youngest forty-one, an assembly of the he very peers—housewives, a machinist, a truck driver, a grocery-store manager, a filing clerk—above whom Lucille Miller had wanted so badly to rise.\n\nThat was the     sin more than the adultery, which tended to reinforce the one for which she was being tried.  It was implicit in booth the defense and the prosecution that Lucille Miller was an erring woman, a woman who perhaps wanted too much.  But to the prosecution she was not merely a woman who would want a new house and want to go to parties and run up high telephone bills ($1152 in two months), but a woman who would go so far as to murder her husband for his $80,000 in insurance, making it appear an accident in order to collect another $40,000 in double indemnity and straight accident policies.  To Turner she was a woman who did not want simply her freedom and a reasonable alimony (she could have had that, the defense contended, by going through with her divorce suit), but wanted everything, a woman motivated by \"love and greed.\"  She was a \"manipulator.\"  She was a user of people.\"\n\nTo Edward Foley, on the other hand, she was an impulsive woman who \"couldn't control her foolish little heart.\"  Where Turner skirted the pregnancy, Foley dwelt upon it, even calling the dead man's mother down from Washington to testify that her son had told her they were going to have another baby because Lucille felt that it would \"do much to weld our home again in the pleasant relations that we used to have.\"  Where the prosecution saw a \"calculator,\" the defense saw a \"blabbermouth,\" and in fact Lucille Miller did emerge as an ingenuous conversationalist.  Just as, before her husband's death, she had confided in her friends about her love affair, so she chatted about it after his death, with the arresting sergeant.  \"Of course Cork lived with it for years, you know,\" her voice was heard to tell Sergeant Paterson on a tape made the morning after her arrest.  \"After Elaine died, he pushed the panic button one night and just asked me right out, and that, I  think, was when he really—the first time he really faced it.\"  When the sergeant asked why she had agreed to talk to him, against the specific instructions of her lawyers, Lucille Miller said airily, \"Oh, I've always been basically quite an honest person. . . . I mean I can put a hat in the cupboard and say it cost ten dollars less, but basically I've always kind of just lived my life the way I wanted to, and if you don't like it you can take off.\"\n\nThe prosecution hinted at men other than Arthwell, and even, over Foley's objections, managed to name one.  The defense called Miller suicidal.  The prosecution produced experts who said that the Volkswagen fire could not have been accidental.  Foley produced witnesses who said that it could have been.  Lucille's father, now a junior-high-school teacher in Oregon, quoted Isaiah to reporters: \"Every tongue that shall rise against thee in judgment thou shalt condemn.\"  \"Lucille did wrong, her affair,\" her mother said judiciously.  \"With her it was love.  But with some I guess it's just passion.\"  There was Debbie, the Millers' fourteen-year-old, testifying in a steady voice about how she and her mother had gone to a supermarket to buy the gasoline can the week before the accident.  There was Sandy Slagle, in the courtroom every day, declaring that on at least one occasion Lucille Miller had prevented her husband not only from committing suicide but from committing suicide in such a way that it would appear an accident and ensure the double-indemnity payment.  There was Wenche Berg, the pretty twenty-seven-year-old Norwegian governess to Arthwell Hayton's children, testifying that Arthwell had instructed her not to allow Lucille Miller to see or talk to the children.\n\nTwo months dragged by, and the headlines never stopped.  Southern California's crime reporters were headquartered in San Bernardino for the duration: Howard Hertel from the Time, Jim Bennett and Eddy Jo Bernal from the Herald-Examiner.  Two months in which the Miller trial was pushed off the Examiner front page only by the Academy Award nominations and Stan Laurel's death.  And finally, on March 2, after Turner had reiterated that it was a case of \"love and greed,\" and Foley had protested that his client was being tried for adultery, the case went to the jury.\n\nThey brought in the verdict, guilty of murder in the first degree, at 4:50 P.m. on March 5.  \"She didn't do it,\" Debbie Miller cried, jumping up from the spectators' section.  \"She didn't do it.\"  Sandy Slagle collapsed in her seat and began to scream.  \"Sandy, for God's sake please don’t,\" Lucille Miller said in a voice that carried across the courtroom, and Sandy Slagle was momentarily subdued.  But as the jurors left the courtroom she screamed again: \"You're murderers. . . . Every last one of you is a murderer.\"  Sheriff's deputies moved in then, each wearing a string tie that read \"1965 SHERIFF'S RODEO,\" and Lucille Miller's father, that sad-faced junior-high-school teacher who believed in the word of Christ and the dangers of wanting to see the world, blew her a kiss off his fingertips.\n\nThe California Institution for Women at Frontera, where Lucille Miller is now, lies down where Euclid Avenue turns into country road, not too many miles from where she once lived and shopped and organized the Heart Fund Ball.  Cattle graze across the road, and Rainbirds sprinkle the alfalfa.  Frontera has a softball field and tennis courts, and looks as if it might be a California junior college, except that the trees are not yet high enough to conceal the concertina wire around the top of the Cyclone fence.  On visitors' day there are big cars in the parking area, big Buicks and Pontiacs that belong to grandparents and sisters and fathers (not many of them belong to husbands), and some of them have bumper stickers that say \"SUPPORT YOUR LOCAL POLICE.\"\n\nA lot of California murderesses live here, a lot of girls who somehow misunderstood the promise.  Don Turner put Sandra Garner here (and her husband in the gas chamber at San Quentin) after the 1959 desert killings known to crime reporters as \"the soda pop murders.\"  Carole Tregoff is here, and has been ever since she was convicted of conspiring to murder Dr. Finch's wife in West Covina, which is not too far from San Bernardino.  Carole Tregoff is in fact a nurse's aide in the prison hospital, and might have attended Lucille Miller had her baby been born at Frontera; Lucille Miller chose instead to have it outside, and paid for the guard who stood outside the delivery room in St. Bernadine’s Hospital.  Debbie Miller came to take the baby home from the hospital, in a white dress with pink ribbons, and Debbie was allowed to choose a name.  She named the baby Kimi Kai.  The children live with Harold and Joan Lance now, because Lucille Miller will probably spend ten years at Frontera.  Don Turner waived his original request for the death penalty (it was generally agreed that he had demanded it only, in Edward Foley's words, \"to get anybody with the slightest trace of human kindness in their veins off the jury\"), and settled for life imprisonment with the possibility of parole.  Lucille Miller does not like it at Frontera, and has had trouble adjusting.  \"She's going to have to learn humility;' Turner says.  \"She's going to have to use her ability to charm, to manipulate.\"\n\nThe new house is empty now, the house on the street with the sign that says\n\nPRIVATE ROAD\nBELLA VISTA\nDEAD END\n\nThe Millers never did get it landscaped, and weeds grow up around the field. stone siding.  The television aerial has toppled on the roof, and a trash can is stuffed with the debris of family life—a cheap suitcase, a child’s game called “Lie Detector.”  There is a sign on what would have been the lawn, and the sign reads “ESTATE SALE.”  Edward Foley is trying to get Lucille Miller's case appealed, but there have been delays. \"A trial always comes down to a matter of sympathy,” Foley says wearily now.  I couldn't create sympathy for her.”   Everyone is a little weary now, weary and resigned, everyone except Sandy Slagle, whose bitterness is still raw.  She lives in an apartment near the medical school in Loma Linda, and studies reports of the case in True Police Cases and Official Detective Stories.  \"I'd much rather we not talk about the Hayton business too much,\"' she tells visitors, and she keeps a tape recorder running.  \"1’d rather talk about Lucille and what a wonderful person she is and how her rights were violated.\"  Harold Lance does not talk to visitors at all.  \"We don't want to give away what we can sell,” he explains pleasantly; an attempt was made to sell Lucille Miller’s personal story to Life, but Life did not want to buy it.  In the district attorney's offices they are prosecuting other murders now, and do not see why the Miller trial attracted so much attention.  \"It wasn’t a very interesting murder as murders go,\" Don Turner says laconically.  Elaine Hayton's death is no longer under investigation.  \"We know everything we want to know,” Turner says.\n\nArthwell Hayton's office is directly below Edward Foleys.  Some people around San Bernardino say that Arthwell Hayton suffered; others say that he did not suffer at all.  Perhaps he did not, for time past is not believed to have any bearing upon time present or future, out in the golden land where every day the world is born anew.  In any case, on October 17, 1965, Arthwell Hayton married again, married his children’s pretty governess, Wenche Berg, at a service in the Chapel of the Roses at a retirement village near Riverside. Later the newlyweds were feted at a reception for seventy-five in the dining room of Rose Garden Village.  The bridegroom was in black tie, with a white carnation in his buttonhole.  The bride wore a long white peau de soie dress and carried a shower bouquet of sweetheart roses with stephanotis streamers.  A coronet of seed pearls held her illusion veil.1Embed","language":"en"}

{"track_id":"08M0nuLM2GDEf9YoxMLmjH","lyrics":"9 ContributorsChilde Harold’s Pilgrimage (Canto 1) LyricsCANTO THE FIRST\nI.\nOh, thou, in Hellas deemed of heavenly birth,\nMuse, formed or fabled at the minstrel's will!\nSince shamed full oft by later lyres on earth,\nMine dares not call thee from thy sacred hill:\nYet there I've wandered by thy vaunted rill;\nYes! sighed o'er Delphi's long-deserted shrine\nWhere, save that feeble fountain, all is still;\nNor mote my shell awake the weary Nine\nTo grace so plain a tale—this lowly lay of mine.\n\nII.\nWhilome in Albion's isle there dwelt a youth,\nWho ne in virtue's ways did take delight;\nBut spent his days in riot most uncouth,\nAnd vexed with mirth the drowsy ear of Night.\nAh, me! in sooth he was a shameless wight,\nSore given to revel and ungodly glee;\nFew earthly things found favour in his sight\nSave concubines and carnal companie,\nAnd flaunting wassailers of high and low degree.\n\nIII.\nChilde Harold was he hight:—but whence his name\nAnd lineage long, it suits me not to say;\nSuffice it, that perchance they were of fame,\nAnd had been glorious in another day:\nBut one sad losel soils a name for aye,\nHowever mighty in the olden time;\nNor all that heralds rake from coffined clay,\nNor florid prose, nor honeyed lines of rhyme,\nCan blazon evil deeds, or consecrate a crime.\nIV.\nChilde Harold basked him in the noontide sun,\nDisporting there like any other fly,\nNor deemed before his little day was done\nOne blast might chill him into misery.\nBut long ere scarce a third of his passed by,\nWorse than adversity the Childe befell;\nHe felt the fulness of satiety:\nThen loathed he in his native land to dwell,\nWhich seemed to him more lone than eremite's sad cell.\n\nV.\nFor he through Sin's long labyrinth had run,\nNor made atonement when he did amiss,\nHad sighed to many, though he loved but one,\nAnd that loved one, alas, could ne'er be his.\nAh, happy she! to 'scape from him whose kiss\nHad been pollution unto aught so chaste;\nWho soon had left her charms for vulgar bliss,\nAnd spoiled her goodly lands to gild his waste,\nNor calm domestic peace had ever deigned to taste.\n\nVI.\nAnd now Childe Harold was sore sick at heart,\nAnd from his fellow bacchanals would flee;\n'Tis said, at times the sullen tear would start,\nBut pride congealed the drop within his e'e:\nApart he stalked in joyless reverie,\nAnd from his native land resolved to go,\nAnd visit scorching climes beyond the sea;\nWith pleasure drugged, he almost longed for woe,\nAnd e'en for change of scene would seek the shades below.\nVII.\nThe Childe departed from his father's hall;\nIt was a vast and venerable pile;\nSo old, it seemed only not to fall,\nYet strength was pillared in each massy aisle.\nMonastic dome! condemned to uses vile!\nWhere superstition once had made her den,\nNow Paphian girls were known to sing and smile;\nAnd monks might deem their time was come agen,\nIf ancient tales say true, nor wrong these holy men.\n\nVIII.\nYet ofttimes in his maddest mirthful mood,\nStrange pangs would flash along Childe Harold's brow,\nAs if the memory of some deadly feud\nOr disappointed passion lurked below:\nBut this none knew, nor haply cared to know;\nFor his was not that open, artless soul\nThat feels relief by bidding sorrow flow;\nNor sought he friend to counsel or condole,\nWhate'er this grief mote be, which he could not control.\n\nIX.\nAnd none did love him: though to hall and bower\nHe gathered revellers from far and near,\nHe knew them flatterers of the festal hour;\nThe heartless parasites of present cheer.\nYea, none did love him—not his lemans dear—\nBut pomp and power alone are woman's care,\nAnd where these are light Eros finds a feere;\nMaidens, like moths, are ever caught by glare,\nAnd Mammon wins his way where seraphs might despair.\nX.\nChilde Harold had a mother—not forgot,\nThough parting from that mother he did shun;\nA sister whom he loved, but saw her not\nBefore his weary pilgrimage begun:\nIf friends he had, he bade adieu to none.\nYet deem not thence his breast a breast of steel;\nYe, who have known what 'tis to dote upon\nA few dear objects, will in sadness feel\nSuch partings break the heart they fondly hope to heal.\n\nXI.\nHis house, his home, his heritage, his lands,\nThe laughing dames in whom he did delight,\nWhose large blue eyes, fair locks, and snowy hands,\nMight shake the saintship of an anchorite,\nAnd long had fed his youthful appetite;\nHis goblets brimmed with every costly wine,\nAnd all that mote to luxury invite,\nWithout a sigh he left to cross the brine,\nAnd traverse Paynim shores, and pass earth's central line.\n\nXII.\nThe sails were filled, and fair the light winds blew\nAs glad to waft him from his native home;\nAnd fast the white rocks faded from his view,\nAnd soon were lost in circumambient foam;\nAnd then, it may be, of his wish to roam\nRepented he, but in his bosom slept\nThe silent thought, nor from his lips did come\nOne word of wail, whilst others sate and wept,\nAnd to the reckless gales unmanly moaning kept.\n\nXIII.\nBut when the sun was sinking in the sea,\nHe seized his harp, which he at times could string,\nAnd strike, albeit with untaught melody,\nWhen deemed he no strange ear was listening:\nAnd now his fingers o'er it he did fling,\nAnd tuned his farewell in the dim twilight,\nWhile flew the vessel on her snowy wing,\nAnd fleeting shores receded from his sight,\nThus to the elements he poured his last 'Good Night.'\n\n1.\nAdieu, adieu! my native shore\nFades o'er the waters blue;\nThe night-winds sigh, the breakers roar,\nAnd shrieks the wild sea-mew.\nYon sun that sets upon the sea\nWe follow in his flight;\nFarewell awhile to him and thee,\nMy Native Land—Good Night!\n\n2.\nA few short hours, and he will rise\nTo give the morrow birth;\nAnd I shall hail the main and skies,\nBut not my mother earth.\nDeserted is my own good hall,\nIts hearth is desolate;\nWild weeds are gathering on the wall,\nMy dog howls at the gate.\n\n3.\n'Come hither, hither, my little page:\nWhy dost thou weep and wail?\nOr dost thou dread the billow's rage,\nOr tremble at the gale?\nBut dash the tear-drop from thine eye,\nOur ship is swift and strong;\nOur fleetest falcon scarce can fly\nMore merrily along.'\n\n4.\n'Let winds be shrill, let waves roll high,\nI fear not wave nor wind;\nYet marvel not, Sir Childe, that I\nAm sorrowful in mind;\nFor I have from my father gone,\nA mother whom I love,\nAnd have no friend, save these alone,\nBut thee—and One above.\n\n5.\n'My father blessed me fervently,\nYet did not much complain;\nBut sorely will my mother sigh\nTill I come back again.'—\n'Enough, enough, my little lad!\nSuch tears become thine eye;\nIf I thy guileless bosom had,\nMine own would not be dry.\n\n6.\n'Come hither, hither, my staunch yeoman,\nWhy dost thou look so pale?\nOr dost thou dread a French foeman,\nOr shiver at the gale?'—\n'Deem'st thou I tremble for my life?\nSir Childe, I'm not so weak;\nBut thinking on an absent wife\nWill blanch a faithful cheek.\n\n7.\n'My spouse and boys dwell near thy hall,\nAlong the bordering lake;\nAnd when they on their father call,\nWhat answer shall she make?'—\n'Enough, enough, my yeoman good,\nThy grief let none gainsay;\nBut I, who am of lighter mood,\nWill laugh to flee away.'\n\n8.\nFor who would trust the seeming sighs\nOf wife or paramour?\nFresh feeres will dry the bright blue eyes\nWe late saw streaming o'er.\nFor pleasures past I do not grieve,\nNor perils gathering near;\nMy greatest grief is that I leave\nNo thing that claims a tear.\n\n9.\nAnd now I'm in the world alone,\nUpon the wide, wide sea;\nBut why should I for others groan,\nWhen none will sigh for me?\nPerchance my dog will whine in vain\nTill fed by stranger hands;\nBut long ere I come back again\nHe'd tear me where he stands.\n\n10.\nWith thee, my bark, I'll swiftly go\nAthwart the foaming brine;\nNor care what land thou bear'st me to,\nSo not again to mine.\nWelcome, welcome, ye dark blue waves!\nAnd when you fail my sight,\nWelcome, ye deserts, and ye caves!\nMy Native Land—Good Night!\n\nXIV.\nOn, on the vessel flies, the land is gone,\nAnd winds are rude in Biscay's sleepless bay.\nFour days are sped, but with the fifth, anon,\nNew shores descried make every bosom gay;\nAnd Cintra's mountain greets them on their way,\nAnd Tagus dashing onward to the deep,\nHis fabled golden tribute bent to pay;\nAnd soon on board the Lusian pilots leap,\nAnd steer 'twixt fertile shores where yet few rustics reap.\n\nXV.\nOh, Christ! it is a goodly sight to see\nWhat Heaven hath done for this delicious land!\nWhat fruits of fragrance blush on every tree!\nWhat goodly prospects o'er the hills expand!\nBut man would mar them with an impious hand:\nAnd when the Almighty lifts his fiercest scourge\n'Gainst those who most transgress his high command,\nWith treble vengeance will his hot shafts urge\nGaul's locust host, and earth from fellest foemen purge.\n\nXVI.\nWhat beauties doth Lisboa first unfold!\nHer image floating on that noble tide,\nWhich poets vainly pave with sands of gold,\nBut now whereon a thousand keels did ride\nOf mighty strength, since Albion was allied,\nAnd to the Lusians did her aid afford\nA nation swoll'n with ignorance and pride,\nWho lick, yet loathe, the hand that waves the sword.\nTo save them from the wrath of Gaul's unsparing lord.\n\nXVII.\nBut whoso entereth within this town,\nThat, sheening far, celestial seems to be,\nDisconsolate will wander up and down,\nMid many things unsightly to strange e'e;\nFor hut and palace show like filthily;\nThe dingy denizens are reared in dirt;\nNo personage of high or mean degree\nDoth care for cleanness of surtout or shirt,\nThough shent with Egypt's plague, unkempt, unwashed, unhurt.\n\nXVIII.\nPoor, paltry slaves! yet born midst noblest scenes—\nWhy, Nature, waste thy wonders on such men?\nLo! Cintra's glorious Eden intervenes\nIn variegated maze of mount and glen.\nAh me! what hand can pencil guide, or pen,\nTo follow half on which the eye dilates\nThrough views more dazzling unto mortal ken\nThan those whereof such things the bard relates,\nWho to the awe-struck world unlocked Elysium's gates?\n\nXIX.\nThe horrid crags, by toppling convent crowned,\nThe cork-trees hoar that clothe the shaggy steep,\nThe mountain moss by scorching skies imbrowned,\nThe sunken glen, whose sunless shrubs must weep,\nThe tender azure of the unruffled deep,\nThe orange tints that gild the greenest bough,\nThe torrents that from cliff to valley leap,\nThe vine on high, the willow branch below,\nMixed in one mighty scene, with varied beauty glow.\n\nXX.\nThen slowly climb the many-winding way,\nAnd frequent turn to linger as you go,\nFrom loftier rocks new loveliness survey,\nAnd rest ye at 'Our Lady's House of Woe;'\nWhere frugal monks their little relics show,\nAnd sundry legends to the stranger tell:\nHere impious men have punished been; and lo,\nDeep in yon cave Honorius long did dwell,\nIn hope to merit Heaven by making earth a Hell.\n\nXXI.\n\nAnd here and there, as up the crags you spring,\nMark many rude-carved crosses near the path;\nYet deem not these devotion's offering—\nThese are memorials frail of murderous wrath;\nFor wheresoe'er the shrieking victim hath\nPoured forth his blood beneath the assassin's knife,\nSome hand erects a cross of mouldering lath;\nAnd grove and glen with thousand such are rife\nThroughout this purple land, where law secures not life!\n\nXXII.\n\nOn sloping mounds, or in the vale beneath,\nAre domes where whilom kings did make repair;\nBut now the wild flowers round them only breathe:\nYet ruined splendour still is lingering there.\nAnd yonder towers the prince's palace fair:\nThere thou, too, Vathek! England's wealthiest son,\nOnce formed thy Paradise, as not aware\nWhen wanton Wealth her mightiest deeds hath done,\nMeek Peace voluptuous lures was ever wont to shun.\n\nXXIII.\n\nHere didst thou dwell, here schemes of pleasure plan.\nBeneath yon mountain's ever beauteous brow;\nBut now, as if a thing unblest by man,\nThy fairy dwelling is as lone as thou!\nHere giant weeds a passage scarce allow\nTo halls deserted, portals gaping wide;\nFresh lessons to the thinking bosom, how\nVain are the pleasaunces on earth supplied;\nSwept into wrecks anon by Time's ungentle tide.\n\nXXIV.\n\nBehold the hall where chiefs were late convened!\nOh! dome displeasing unto British eye!\nWith diadem hight foolscap, lo! a fiend,\nA little fiend that scoffs incessantly,\nThere sits in parchment robe arrayed, and by\nHis side is hung a seal and sable scroll,\nWhere blazoned glare names known to chivalry,\nAnd sundry signatures adorn the roll,\nWhereat the urchin points, and laughs with all his soul.\n\nXXV.\n\nConvention is the dwarfish demon styled\nThat foiled the knights in Marialva's dome:\nOf brains (if brains they had) he them beguiled,\nAnd turned a nation's shallow joy to gloom.\nHere Folly dashed to earth the victor's plume,\nAnd Policy regained what Arms had lost:\nFor chiefs like ours in vain may laurels bloom!\nWoe to the conquering, not the conquered host,\nSince baffled Triumph droops on Lusitania's coast.\n\nXXVI.\n\nAnd ever since that martial synod met,\nBritannia sickens, Cintra, at thy name;\nAnd folks in office at the mention fret,\nAnd fain would blush, if blush they could, for shame.\nHow will posterity the deed proclaim!\nWill not our own and fellow-nations sneer,\nTo view these champions cheated of their fame,\nBy foes in fight o'erthrown, yet victors here,\nWhere Scorn her finger points through many a coming year?\n\nXXVII.\n\nSo deemed the Childe, as o'er the mountains he\nDid take his way in solitary guise:\nSweet was the scene, yet soon he thought to flee,\nMore restless than the swallow in the skies:\nThough here awhile he learned to moralise,\nFor Meditation fixed at times on him,\nAnd conscious Reason whispered to despise\nHis early youth misspent in maddest whim;\nBut as he gazed on Truth, his aching eyes grew dim.\n\nXXVIII.\n\nTo horse! to horse! he quits, for ever quits\nA scene of peace, though soothing to his soul:\nAgain he rouses from his moping fits,\nBut seeks not now the harlot and the bowl.\nOnward he flies, nor fixed as yet the goal\nWhere he shall rest him on his pilgrimage;\nAnd o'er him many changing scenes must roll,\nEre toil his thirst for travel can assuage,\nOr he shall calm his breast, or learn experience sage.\n\nXXIX.\n\nYet Mafra shall one moment claim delay,\nWhere dwelt of yore the Lusians' luckless queen;\nAnd church and court did mingle their array,\nAnd mass and revel were alternate seen;\nLordlings and freres—ill-sorted fry, I ween!\nBut here the Babylonian whore had built\nA dome, where flaunts she in such glorious sheen,\nThat men forget the blood which she hath spilt,\nAnd bow the knee to Pomp that loves to garnish guilt.\n\nXXX.\n\nO'er vales that teem with fruits, romantic hills,\n(Oh that such hills upheld a free-born race!)\nWhereon to gaze the eye with joyaunce fills,\nChilde Harold wends through many a pleasant place.\nThough sluggards deem it but a foolish chase,\nAnd marvel men should quit their easy chair,\nThe toilsome way, and long, long league to trace.\nOh, there is sweetness in the mountain air\nAnd life, that bloated Ease can never hope to share.\n\nXXXI.\n\nMore bleak to view the hills at length recede,\nAnd, less luxuriant, smoother vales extend:\nImmense horizon-bounded plains succeed!\nFar as the eye discerns, withouten end,\nSpain's realms appear, whereon her shepherds tend\nFlocks, whose rich fleece right well the trader knows—\nNow must the pastor's arm his lambs defend:\nFor Spain is compassed by unyielding foes,\nAnd all must shield their all, or share Subjection's woes.\n\nXXXII.\n\nWhere Lusitania and her Sister meet,\nDeem ye what bounds the rival realms divide?\nOr e'er the jealous queens of nations greet,\nDoth Tayo interpose his mighty tide?\nOr dark sierras rise in craggy pride?\nOr fence of art, like China's vasty wall?—\nNe barrier wall, ne river deep and wide,\nNe horrid crags, nor mountains dark and tall\nRise like the rocks that part Hispania's land from Gaul\n\nXXXIII.\n\nBut these between a silver streamlet glides,\nAnd scarce a name distinguisheth the brook,\nThough rival kingdoms press its verdant sides.\nHere leans the idle shepherd on his crook,\nAnd vacant on the rippling waves doth look,\nThat peaceful still 'twixt bitterest foemen flow:\nFor proud each peasant as the noblest duke:\nWell doth the Spanish hind the difference know\n'Twixt him and Lusian slave, the lowest of the low.\n\nXXXIV.\n\nBut ere the mingling bounds have far been passed,\nDark Guadiana rolls his power along\nIn sullen billows, murmuring and vast,\nSo noted ancient roundelays among.\nWhilome upon his banks did legions throng\nOf Moor and Knight, in mailed splendour drest;\nHere ceased the swift their race, here sunk the strong;\nThe Paynim turban and the Christian crest\nMixed on the bleeding stream, by floating hosts oppressed.\n\nXXXV.\n\nOh, lovely Spain! renowned, romantic land!\nWhere is that standard which Pelagio bore,\nWhen Cava's traitor-sire first called the band\nThat dyed thy mountain-streams with Gothic gore?\nWhere are those bloody banners which of yore\nWaved o'er thy sons, victorious to the gale,\nAnd drove at last the spoilers to their shore?\nRed gleamed the cross, and waned the crescent pale,\nWhile Afric's echoes thrilled with Moorish matrons' wail.\n\nXXXVI.\n\nTeems not each ditty with the glorious tale?\nAh! such, alas, the hero's amplest fate!\nWhen granite moulders and when records fail,\nA peasant's plaint prolongs his dubious date.\nPride! bend thine eye from heaven to thine estate,\nSee how the mighty shrink into a song!\nCan volume, pillar, pile, preserve thee great?\nOr must thou trust Tradition's simple tongue,\nWhen Flattery sleeps with thee, and History does thee wrong?\n\nXXXVII.\n\nAwake, ye sons of Spain! awake! advance\nLo! Chivalry, your ancient goddess, cries,\nBut wields not, as of old, her thirsty lance,\nNor shakes her crimson plumage in the skies:\nNow on the smoke of blazing bolts she flies,\nAnd speaks in thunder through yon engine's roar!\nIn every peal she calls—'Awake! arise!'\nSay, is her voice more feeble than of yore,\nWhen her war-song was heard on Andalusia's shore?\n\nXXXVIII.\n\nHark! heard you not those hoofs of dreadful note?\nSounds not the clang of conflict on the heath?\nSaw ye not whom the reeking sabre smote;\nNor saved your brethren ere they sank beneath\nTyrants and tyrants' slaves?—the fires of death,\nThe bale-fires flash on high:—from rock to rock\nEach volley tells that thousands cease to breathe:\nDeath rides upon the sulphury Siroc,\nRed Battle stamps his foot, and nations feel the shock.\n\nXXXIX.\n\nLo! where the Giant on the mountain stands,\nHis blood-red tresses deepening in the sun,\nWith death-shot glowing in his fiery hands,\nAnd eye that scorcheth all it glares upon;\nRestless it rolls, now fixed, and now anon\nFlashing afar,—and at his iron feet\nDestruction cowers, to mark what deeds are done;\nFor on this morn three potent nations meet,\nTo shed before his shrine the blood he deems most sweet.\n\nXL.\n\nBy Heaven! it is a splendid sight to see\n(For one who hath no friend, no brother there)\nTheir rival scarfs of mixed embroidery,\nTheir various arms that glitter in the air!\nWhat gallant war-hounds rouse them from their lair,\nAnd gnash their fangs, loud yelling for the prey!\nAll join the chase, but few the triumph share:\nThe Grave shall bear the chiefest prize away,\nAnd Havoc scarce for joy can cumber their array.\n\nXLI.\n\nThree hosts combine to offer sacrifice;\nThree tongues prefer strange orisons on high;\nThree gaudy standards flout the pale blue skies.\nThe shouts are France, Spain, Albion, Victory!\nThe foe, the victim, and the fond ally\nThat fights for all, but ever fights in vain,\nAre met—as if at home they could not die—\nTo feed the crow on Talavera's plain,\nAnd fertilise the field that each pretends to gain.\n\nXLII.\n\nThere shall they rot—Ambition's honoured fools!\nYes, Honour decks the turf that wraps their clay!\nVain Sophistry! in these behold the tools,\nThe broken tools, that tyrants cast away\nBy myriads, when they dare to pave their way\nWith human hearts—to what?—a dream alone.\nCan despots compass aught that hails their sway?\nOr call with truth one span of earth their own,\nSave that wherein at last they crumble bone by bone?\n\nXLIII.\n\nO Albuera, glorious field of grief!\nAs o'er thy plain the Pilgrim pricked his steed,\nWho could foresee thee, in a space so brief,\nA scene where mingling foes should boast and bleed.\nPeace to the perished! may the warrior's meed\nAnd tears of triumph their reward prolong!\nTill others fall where other chieftains lead,\nThy name shall circle round the gaping throng,\nAnd shine in worthless lays, the theme of transient song.\n\nXLIV.\n\nEnough of Battle's minions! let them play\nTheir game of lives, and barter breath for fame:\nFame that will scarce reanimate their clay,\nThough thousands fall to deck some single name.\nIn sooth, 'twere sad to thwart their noble aim\nWho strike, blest hirelings! for their country's good,\nAnd die, that living might have proved her shame;\nPerished, perchance, in some domestic feud,\nOr in a narrower sphere wild Rapine's path pursued.\n\nXLV.\n\nFull swiftly Harold wends his lonely way\nWhere proud Sevilla triumphs unsubdued:\nYet is she free—the spoiler's wished-for prey!\nSoon, soon shall Conquest's fiery foot intrude,\nBlackening her lovely domes with traces rude.\nInevitable hour!  'Gainst fate to strive\nWhere Desolation plants her famished brood\nIs vain, or Ilion, Tyre, might yet survive,\nAnd Virtue vanquish all, and Murder cease to thrive.\n\nXLVI.\n\nBut all unconscious of the coming doom,\nThe feast, the song, the revel here abounds;\nStrange modes of merriment the hours consume,\nNor bleed these patriots with their country's wounds;\nNor here War's clarion, but Love's rebeck sounds;\nHere Folly still his votaries enthralls,\nAnd young-eyed Lewdness walks her midnight rounds:\nGirt with the silent crimes of capitals,\nStill to the last kind Vice clings to the tottering walls.\n\nXLVII.\n\nNot so the rustic:  with his trembling mate\nHe lurks, nor casts his heavy eye afar,\nLest he should view his vineyard desolate,\nBlasted below the dun hot breath of war.\nNo more beneath soft Eve's consenting star\nFandango twirls his jocund castanet:\nAh, monarchs! could ye taste the mirth ye mar,\nNot in the toils of Glory would ye fret;\nThe hoarse dull drum would sleep, and Man be happy yet.\n\nXLVIII.\n\nHow carols now the lusty muleteer?\nOf love, romance, devotion is his lay,\nAs whilome he was wont the leagues to cheer,\nHis quick bells wildly jingling on the way?\nNo! as he speeds, he chants 'Viva el Rey!'\nAnd checks his song to execrate Godoy,\nThe royal wittol Charles, and curse the day\nWhen first Spain's queen beheld the black-eyed boy,\nAnd gore-faced Treason sprung from her adulterate joy.\n\nXLIX.\n\nOn yon long level plain, at distance crowned\nWith crags, whereon those Moorish turrets rest,\nWide scattered hoof-marks dint the wounded ground;\nAnd, scathed by fire, the greensward's darkened vest\nTells that the foe was Andalusia's guest:\nHere was the camp, the watch-flame, and the host,\nHere the brave peasant stormed the dragon's nest;\nStill does he mark it with triumphant boast,\nAnd points to yonder cliffs, which oft were won and lost.\n\nL.\n\nAnd whomsoe'er along the path you meet\nBears in his cap the badge of crimson hue,\nWhich tells you whom to shun and whom to greet:\nWoe to the man that walks in public view\nWithout of loyalty this token true:\nSharp is the knife, and sudden is the stroke;\nAnd sorely would the Gallic foemen rue,\nIf subtle poniards, wrapt beneath the cloak,\nCould blunt the sabre's edge, or clear the cannon's smoke.\n\nLI.\n\nAt every turn Morena's dusky height\nSustains aloft the battery's iron load;\nAnd, far as mortal eye can compass sight,\nThe mountain-howitzer, the broken road,\nThe bristling palisade, the fosse o'erflowed,\nThe stationed bands, the never-vacant watch,\nThe magazine in rocky durance stowed,\nThe holstered steed beneath the shed of thatch,\nThe ball-piled pyramid, the ever-blazing match,\n\nLII.\n\nPortend the deeds to come:—but he whose nod\nHas tumbled feebler despots from their sway,\nA moment pauseth ere he lifts the rod;\nA little moment deigneth to delay:\nSoon will his legions sweep through these the way;\nThe West must own the Scourger of the world.\nAh, Spain! how sad will be thy reckoning day,\nWhen soars Gaul's Vulture, with his wings unfurled,\nAnd thou shalt view thy sons in crowds to Hades hurled.\n\nLIII.\n\nAnd must they fall—the young, the proud, the brave—\nTo swell one bloated chief's unwholesome reign?\nNo step between submission and a grave?\nThe rise of rapine and the fall of Spain?\nAnd doth the Power that man adores ordain\nTheir doom, nor heed the suppliant's appeal?\nIs all that desperate Valour acts in vain?\nAnd Counsel sage, and patriotic Zeal,\nThe veteran's skill, youth's fire, and manhood's heart of steel?\n\nLIV.\n\nIs it for this the Spanish maid, aroused,\nHangs on the willow her unstrung guitar,\nAnd, all unsexed, the anlace hath espoused,\nSung the loud song, and dared the deed of war?\nAnd she, whom once the semblance of a scar\nAppalled, an owlet's larum chilled with dread,\nNow views the column-scattering bayonet jar,\nThe falchion flash, and o'er the yet warm dead\nStalks with Minerva's step where Mars might quake to tread.\n\nLV.\n\nYe who shall marvel when you hear her tale,\nOh! had you known her in her softer hour,\nMarked her black eye that mocks her coal-black veil,\nHeard her light, lively tones in lady's bower,\nSeen her long locks that foil the painter's power,\nHer fairy form, with more than female grace,\nScarce would you deem that Saragoza's tower\nBeheld her smile in Danger's Gorgon face,\nThin the closed ranks, and lead in Glory's fearful chase.\n\nLVI.\n\nHer lover sinks—she sheds no ill-timed tear;\nHer chief is slain—she fills his fatal post;\nHer fellows flee—she checks their base career;\nThe foe retires—she heads the sallying host:\nWho can appease like her a lover's ghost?\nWho can avenge so well a leader's fall?\nWhat maid retrieve when man's flushed hope is lost?\nWho hang so fiercely on the flying Gaul,\nFoiled by a woman's hand, before a battered wall?\n\nLVII.\n\nYet are Spain's maids no race of Amazons,\nBut formed for all the witching arts of love:\nThough thus in arms they emulate her sons,\nAnd in the horrid phalanx dare to move,\n'Tis but the tender fierceness of the dove,\nPecking the hand that hovers o'er her mate:\nIn softness as in firmness far above\nRemoter females, famed for sickening prate;\nHer mind is nobler sure, her charms perchance as great.\n\nLVIII.\n\nThe seal Love's dimpling finger hath impressed\nDenotes how soft that chin which bears his touch:\nHer lips, whose kisses pout to leave their nest,\nBid man be valiant ere he merit such:\nHer glance, how wildly beautiful! how much\nHath Phoebus wooed in vain to spoil her cheek\nWhich glows yet smoother from his amorous clutch!\nWho round the North for paler dames would seek?\nHow poor their forms appear? how languid, wan, and weak!\n\nLIX.\n\nMatch me, ye climes! which poets love to laud;\nMatch me, ye harems! of the land where now\nI strike my strain, far distant, to applaud\nBeauties that even a cynic must avow!\nMatch me those houris, whom ye scarce allow\nTo taste the gale lest Love should ride the wind,\nWith Spain's dark-glancing daughters—deign to know,\nThere your wise Prophet's paradise we find,\nHis black-eyed maids of Heaven, angelically kind.\n\nLX.\n\nO thou, Parnassus! whom I now survey,\nNot in the frenzy of a dreamer's eye,\nNot in the fabled landscape of a lay,\nBut soaring snow-clad through thy native sky,\nIn the wild pomp of mountain majesty!\nWhat marvel if I thus essay to sing?\nThe humblest of thy pilgrims passing by\nWould gladly woo thine echoes with his string,\nThough from thy heights no more one muse will wave her wing.\n\nLXI.\n\nOft have I dreamed of thee! whose glorious name\nWho knows not, knows not man's divinest lore:\nAnd now I view thee, 'tis, alas, with shame\nThat I in feeblest accents must adore.\nWhen I recount thy worshippers of yore\nI tremble, and can only bend the knee;\nNor raise my voice, nor vainly dare to soar,\nBut gaze beneath thy cloudy canopy\nIn silent joy to think at last I look on thee!\n\nLXII.\n\nHappier in this than mightiest bards have been,\nWhose fate to distant homes confined their lot,\nShall I unmoved behold the hallowed scene,\nWhich others rave of, though they know it not?\nThough here no more Apollo haunts his grot,\nAnd thou, the Muses' seat, art now their grave,\nSome gentle spirit still pervades the spot,\nSighs in the gale, keeps silence in the cave,\nAnd glides with glassy foot o'er yon melodious wave.\n\nLXIII.\n\nOf thee hereafter.—Even amidst my strain\nI turned aside to pay my homage here;\nForgot the land, the sons, the maids of Spain;\nHer fate, to every free-born bosom dear;\nAnd hailed thee, not perchance without a tear.\nNow to my theme—but from thy holy haunt\nLet me some remnant, some memorial bear;\nYield me one leaf of Daphne's deathless plant,\nNor let thy votary's hope be deemed an idle vaunt.\n\nLXIV.\n\nBut ne'er didst thou, fair mount, when Greece was young,\nSee round thy giant base a brighter choir;\nNor e'er did Delphi, when her priestess sung\nThe Pythian hymn with more than mortal fire,\nBehold a train more fitting to inspire\nThe song of love than Andalusia's maids,\nNurst in the glowing lap of soft desire:\nAh! that to these were given such peaceful shades\nAs Greece can still bestow, though Glory fly her glades.\n\nLXV.\n\nFair is proud Seville; let her country boast\nHer strength, her wealth, her site of ancient days,\nBut Cadiz, rising on the distant coast,\nCalls forth a sweeter, though ignoble praise.\nAh, Vice! how soft are thy voluptuous ways!\nWhile boyish blood is mantling, who can 'scape\nThe fascination of thy magic gaze?\nA cherub-hydra round us dost thou gape,\nAnd mould to every taste thy dear delusive shape.\n\nLXVI.\n\nWhen Paphos fell by Time—accursed Time!\nThe Queen who conquers all must yield to thee—\nThe Pleasures fled, but sought as warm a clime;\nAnd Venus, constant to her native sea,\nTo nought else constant, hither deigned to flee,\nAnd fixed her shrine within these walls of white;\nThough not to one dome circumscribeth she\nHer worship, but, devoted to her rite,\nA thousand altars rise, for ever blazing bright.\n\nLXVII.\n\nFrom morn till night, from night till startled morn\nPeeps blushing on the revel's laughing crew,\nThe song is heard, the rosy garland worn;\nDevices quaint, and frolics ever new,\nTread on each other's kibes.  A long adieu\nHe bids to sober joy that here sojourns:\nNought interrupts the riot, though in lieu\nOf true devotion monkish incense burns,\nAnd love and prayer unite, or rule the hour by turns.\n\nLXVIII.\n\nThe sabbath comes, a day of blessed rest;\nWhat hallows it upon this Christian shore?\nLo! it is sacred to a solemn feast:\nHark! heard you not the forest monarch's roar?\nCrashing the lance, he snuffs the spouting gore\nOf man and steed, o'erthrown beneath his horn:\nThe thronged arena shakes with shouts for more;\nYells the mad crowd o'er entrails freshly torn,\nNor shrinks the female eye, nor e'en affects to mourn.\n\nLXIX.\n\nThe seventh day this; the jubilee of man.\nLondon! right well thou know'st the day of prayer:\nThen thy spruce citizen, washed artizan,\nAnd smug apprentice gulp their weekly air:\nThy coach of hackney, whiskey, one-horse chair,\nAnd humblest gig, through sundry suburbs whirl;\nTo Hampstead, Brentford, Harrow, make repair;\nTill the tired jade the wheel forgets to hurl,\nProvoking envious gibe from each pedestrian churl.\n\nLXX.\n\nSome o'er thy Thamis row the ribboned fair,\nOthers along the safer turnpike fly;\nSome Richmond Hill ascend, some scud to Ware,\nAnd many to the steep of Highgate hie.\nAsk ye, Boeotian shades, the reason why?\n'Tis to the worship of the solemn Horn,\nGrasped in the holy hand of Mystery,\nIn whose dread name both men and maids are sworn,\nAnd consecrate the oath with draught and dance till morn.\n\nLXXI.\n\nAll have their fooleries; not alike are thine,\nFair Cadiz, rising o'er the dark blue sea!\nSoon as the matin bell proclaimeth nine,\nThy saint adorers count the rosary:\nMuch is the Virgin teased to shrive them free\n(Well do I ween the only virgin there)\nFrom crimes as numerous as her beadsmen be;\nThen to the crowded circus forth they fare:\nYoung, old, high, low, at once the same diversion share.\n\nLXXII.\n\nThe lists are oped, the spacious area cleared,\nThousands on thousands piled are seated round;\nLong ere the first loud trumpet's note is heard,\nNo vacant space for lated wight is found:\nHere dons, grandees, but chiefly dames abound,\nSkilled in the ogle of a roguish eye,\nYet ever well inclined to heal the wound;\nNone through their cold disdain are doomed to die,\nAs moon-struck bards complain, by Love's sad archery.\n\nLXXIII.\n\nHushed is the din of tongues—on gallant steeds,\nWith milk-white crest, gold spur, and light-poised lance,\nFour cavaliers prepare for venturous deeds,\nAnd lowly bending to the lists advance;\nRich are their scarfs, their chargers featly prance:\nIf in the dangerous game they shine to-day,\nThe crowd's loud shout, and ladies' lovely glance,\nBest prize of better acts, they bear away,\nAnd all that kings or chiefs e'er gain their toils repay.\n\nLXXIV.\n\nIn costly sheen and gaudy cloak arrayed,\nBut all afoot, the light-limbed matadore\nStands in the centre, eager to invade\nThe lord of lowing herds; but not before\nThe ground, with cautious tread, is traversed o'er,\nLest aught unseen should lurk to thwart his speed:\nHis arms a dart, he fights aloof, nor more\nCan man achieve without the friendly steed—\nAlas! too oft condemned for him to bear and bleed.\n\nLXXV.\n\nThrice sounds the clarion; lo! the signal falls,\nThe den expands, and expectation mute\nGapes round the silent circle's peopled walls.\nBounds with one lashing spring the mighty brute,\nAnd wildly staring, spurns, with sounding foot,\nThe sand, nor blindly rushes on his foe:\nHere, there, he points his threatening front, to suit\nHis first attack, wide waving to and fro\nHis angry tail; red rolls his eye's dilated glow.\n\nLXXVI.\n\nSudden he stops; his eye is fixed:  away,\nAway, thou heedless boy! prepare the spear;\nNow is thy time to perish, or display\nThe skill that yet may check his mad career.\nWith well-timed croupe the nimble coursers veer;\nOn foams the bull, but not unscathed he goes;\nStreams from his flank the crimson torrent clear:\nHe flies, he wheels, distracted with his throes:\nDart follows dart; lance, lance; loud bellowings speak his woes.\n\nLXXVII.\n\nAgain he comes; nor dart nor lance avail,\nNor the wild plunging of the tortured horse;\nThough man and man's avenging arms assail,\nVain are his weapons, vainer is his force.\nOne gallant steed is stretched a mangled corse;\nAnother, hideous sight! unseamed appears,\nHis gory chest unveils life's panting source;\nThough death-struck, still his feeble frame he rears;\nStaggering, but stemming all, his lord unharmed he bears.\n\nLXXVIII.\n\nFoiled, bleeding, breathless, furious to the last,\nFull in the centre stands the bull at bay,\nMid wounds, and clinging darts, and lances brast,\nAnd foes disabled in the brutal fray:\nAnd now the matadores around him play,\nShake the red cloak, and poise the ready brand:\nOnce more through all he bursts his thundering way—\nVain rage! the mantle quits the conynge hand,\nWraps his fierce eye—'tis past—he sinks upon the sand.\n\nLXXIX.\n\nWhere his vast neck just mingles with the spine,\nSheathed in his form the deadly weapon lies.\nHe stops—he starts—disdaining to decline:\nSlowly he falls, amidst triumphant cries,\nWithout a groan, without a struggle dies.\nThe decorated car appears on high:\nThe corse is piled—sweet sight for vulgar eyes;\nFour steeds that spurn the rein, as swift as shy,\nHurl the dark bull along, scarce seen in dashing by.\n\nLXXX.\n\nSuch the ungentle sport that oft invites\nThe Spanish maid, and cheers the Spanish swain:\nNurtured in blood betimes, his heart delights\nIn vengeance, gloating on another's pain.\nWhat private feuds the troubled village stain!\nThough now one phalanxed host should meet the foe,\nEnough, alas, in humble homes remain,\nTo meditate 'gainst friends the secret blow,\nFor some slight cause of wrath, whence life's warm stream must flow.\n\nLXXXI.\n\nBut Jealousy has fled:  his bars, his bolts,\nHis withered sentinel, duenna sage!\nAnd all whereat the generous soul revolts,\nWhich the stern dotard deemed he could encage,\nHave passed to darkness with the vanished age.\nWho late so free as Spanish girls were seen\n(Ere War uprose in his volcanic rage),\nWith braided tresses bounding o'er the green,\nWhile on the gay dance shone Night's lover-loving Queen?\n\nLXXXII.\n\nOh! many a time and oft had Harold loved,\nOr dreamed he loved, since rapture is a dream;\nBut now his wayward bosom was unmoved,\nFor not yet had he drunk of Lethe's stream:\nAnd lately had he learned with truth to deem\nLove has no gift so grateful as his wings:\nHow fair, how young, how soft soe'er he seem,\nFull from the fount of joy's delicious springs\nSome bitter o'er the flowers its bubbling venom flings.\n\nLXXXIII.\n\nYet to the beauteous form he was not blind,\nThough now it moved him as it moves the wise;\nNot that Philosophy on such a mind\nE'er deigned to bend her chastely-awful eyes:\nBut Passion raves itself to rest, or flies;\nAnd Vice, that digs her own voluptuous tomb,\nHad buried long his hopes, no more to rise:\nPleasure's palled victim! life-abhorring gloom\nWrote on his faded brow curst Cain's unresting doom.\n\nLXXXIV.\n\nStill he beheld, nor mingled with the throng;\nBut viewed them not with misanthropic hate;\nFain would he now have joined the dance, the song,\nBut who may smile that sinks beneath his fate?\nNought that he saw his sadness could abate:\nYet once he struggled 'gainst the demon's sway,\nAnd as in Beauty's bower he pensive sate,\nPoured forth this unpremeditated lay,\nTo charms as fair as those that soothed his happier day.\n\nTO INEZ.\n\nNay, smile not at my sullen brow,\nAlas! I cannot smile again:\nYet Heaven avert that ever thou\nShouldst weep, and haply weep in vain.\n\nAnd dost thou ask what secret woe\nI bear, corroding joy and youth?\nAnd wilt thou vainly seek to know\nA pang even thou must fail to soothe?\n\nIt is not love, it is not hate,\nNor low Ambition's honours lost,\nThat bids me loathe my present state,\nAnd fly from all I prized the most:\n\nIt is that weariness which springs\nFrom all I meet, or hear, or see:\nTo me no pleasure Beauty brings;\nThine eyes have scarce a charm for me.\n\nIt is that settled, ceaseless gloom\nThe fabled Hebrew wanderer bore,\nThat will not look beyond the tomb,\nBut cannot hope for rest before.\n\nWhat exile from himself can flee?\nTo zones, though more and more remote,\nStill, still pursues, where'er I be,\nThe blight of life—the demon Thought.\n\nYet others rapt in pleasure seem,\nAnd taste of all that I forsake:\nOh! may they still of transport dream,\nAnd ne'er, at least like me, awake!\n\nThrough many a clime 'tis mine to go,\nWith many a retrospection curst;\nAnd all my solace is to know,\nWhate'er betides, I've known the worst.\n\nWhat is that worst?  Nay, do not ask—\nIn pity from the search forbear:\nSmile on—nor venture to unmask\nMan's heart, and view the hell that's there.\n\nLXXXV.\n\nAdieu, fair Cadiz! yea, a long adieu!\nWho may forget how well thy walls have stood?\nWhen all were changing, thou alone wert true,\nFirst to be free, and last to be subdued.\nAnd if amidst a scene, a shock so rude,\nSome native blood was seen thy streets to dye,\nA traitor only fell beneath the feud:\nHere all were noble, save nobility;\nNone hugged a conqueror's chain save fallen Chivalry!\n\nLXXXVI.\n\nSuch be the sons of Spain, and strange her fate!\nThey fight for freedom, who were never free;\nA kingless people for a nerveless state,\nHer vassals combat when their chieftains flee,\nTrue to the veriest slaves of Treachery;\nFond of a land which gave them nought but life,\nPride points the path that leads to liberty;\nBack to the struggle, baffled in the strife,\nWar, war is still the cry, 'War even to the knife!'\n\nLXXXVII.\n\nYe, who would more of Spain and Spaniards know,\nGo, read whate'er is writ of bloodiest strife:\nWhate'er keen Vengeance urged on foreign foe\nCan act, is acting there against man's life:\nFrom flashing scimitar to secret knife,\nWar mouldeth there each weapon to his need—\nSo may he guard the sister and the wife,\nSo may he make each curst oppressor bleed,\nSo may such foes deserve the most remorseless deed!\n\nLXXXVIII.\n\nFlows there a tear of pity for the dead?\nLook o'er the ravage of the reeking plain:\nLook on the hands with female slaughter red;\nThen to the dogs resign the unburied slain,\nThen to the vulture let each corse remain;\nAlbeit unworthy of the prey-bird's maw,\nLet their bleached bones, and blood's unbleaching stain,\nLong mark the battle-field with hideous awe:\nThus only may our sons conceive the scenes we saw!\n\nLXXXIX.\n\nNor yet, alas, the dreadful work is done;\nFresh legions pour adown the Pyrenees:\nIt deepens still, the work is scarce begun,\nNor mortal eye the distant end foresees.\nFall'n nations gaze on Spain:  if freed, she frees\nMore than her fell Pizarros once enchained.\nStrange retribution! now Columbia's ease\nRepairs the wrongs that Quito's sons sustained,\nWhile o'er the parent clime prowls Murder unrestrained.\n\nXC.\n\nNot all the blood at Talavera shed,\nNot all the marvels of Barossa's fight,\nNot Albuera lavish of the dead,\nHave won for Spain her well-asserted right.\nWhen shall her Olive-Branch be free from blight?\nWhen shall she breathe her from the blushing toil?\nHow many a doubtful day shall sink in night,\nEre the Frank robber turn him from his spoil,\nAnd Freedom's stranger-tree grow native of the soil?\n\nXCI.\n\nAnd thou, my friend! since unavailing woe\nBursts from my heart, and mingles with the strain—\nHad the sword laid thee with the mighty low,\nPride might forbid e'en Friendship to complain:\nBut thus unlaurelled to descend in vain,\nBy all forgotten, save the lonely breast,\nAnd mix unbleeding with the boasted slain,\nWhile glory crowns so many a meaner crest!\nWhat hadst thou done, to sink so peacefully to rest?\n\nXCII.\n\nOh, known the earliest, and esteemed the most!\nDear to a heart where nought was left so dear!\nThough to my hopeless days for ever lost,\nIn dreams deny me not to see thee here!\nAnd Morn in secret shall renew the tear\nOf Consciousness awaking to her woes,\nAnd Fancy hover o'er thy bloodless bier,\nTill my frail frame return to whence it rose,\nAnd mourned and mourner lie united in repose.\n\nXCIII.\n\nHere is one fytte of Harold's pilgrimage.\nYe who of him may further seek to know,\nShall find some tidings in a future page,\nIf he that rhymeth now may scribble moe.\nIs this too much?  Stern critic, say not so:\nPatience! and ye shall hear what he beheld\nIn other lands, where he was doomed to go:\nLands that contain the monuments of eld,\nEre Greece and Grecian arts by barbarous hands were quelled.Embed","language":"en"}
